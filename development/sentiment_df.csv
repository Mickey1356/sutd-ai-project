0,"if you haven’t heard about the five monkeys experiment, it goes a little something like this: a researcher puts five monkeys in a cage. there’s a bunch of bananas hanging from a string, with a ladder leading to the bananas. when the first monkey goes for the bananas, the researcher sprays all five monkeys with freezing water for five minutes. some time later, when a second monkey inevitably tries to go for the bananas, the researcher once again sprays all five monkeys with the cold water for five minutes. the researcher then puts the hose away and never touches it again. but, when a third monkey tries to go for the bananas, the other four attack him to prevent him from climbing that ladder. they are afraid of the punishment that may come. then, the researcher replaces one of the monkeys with a new monkey who wasn’t part of the original experiment and was never sprayed with water. and, as soon as he touches the ladder to go for the bananas, the other four monkeys attack him to keep him from doing so. if he tries again, they attack him again. thus, the new monkey learns not to go after the bananas because he’ll get attacked if he does. the researcher replaces a second monkey with another new monkey. when this monkey goes for the bananas, the other four attack him, including the new monkey who was never sprayed with water. the researcher then continues to replace all the monkeys one at a time, until all five of the original monkeys are removed from the cage. each time the newcomer goes for the bananas, the others attack, even when they, as new monkeys, have never received punishment for going after the bananas. and thus, the new monkeys, who have never been sprayed with cold water, learn not to go after the temptation of the bananas. the researchers hypothesize that, if they were to ask the monkeys why they don’t go for the bananas, they’d answer “because that’s the way it’s always been done”. gains are gains, 1 or 2 or 3 gamma squeezes won’t break institutional suites / hfs. winning a battle doesn’t win the war. as the retail investor accounts get larger that targets ‘market shorts’ as a whole, that’s how you break their backs. $amc $gme $clov and the rest of the meme stocks need targeted to break them. stop eating your own!",-2
1,"tldr: yolo paradox. can i bet bigger, to practice on a true yolo? what’s the right balance for you? context. have some money in a boring diversified portfolio that has done ok for me. but it’s slow and not much fun. started buying a little on the side, funded by extra project work. money i could theoretically do without. so far i’m beating my regular portfolio by 40+ points. nice wide margin. so… i’m feeling that gambler’s high. i’m winning a little bit, but it’s slow. bigger bets mean bigger payoffs. scared money don’t make no money. just insert your cliche here. however… married, 2 kids, 1 who will shortly be going to an outrageously expensive college. so if i’m going to jump, i’m damn well going to do exhaustive dd before i jump. paper trading seems… hollow. i think i need that danger of real loss to keep me at my best. never traded options before. just equities and 2 coins. i understand the general concepts but i wouldn’t know enough to even attempt one. positions. nothing crazy. sold all my gme at a loss, because i’m an idiot and had just started trading. so i freaked out like a paper handed bitch. sold all my amc at $6 for a tiny profit, because i’m an idiot and i wanted to compensate for the gme loss. holding my nok and bb because i don’t want to repeat my goddamned gme and amc mistakes. pretty much everything else has done ok as i learned to average down and not be a fucking cowardly sheep. up 31% ytd overall. thanks apes!",-2
2,"we need to look at the probabilities over possibilities. yes we can squeeze a bunch of other tickers but some of the most ripe ones have been gme, amc and the next clov. don’t believe me? look at s3 partners daily analysis of most shorted stocks. the most shorted stocks are the ones we are after and past gme and amc is clov. why? because it’s in its infancy and what we witnessed today was a short ladder attack followed by retail fear and selling. im not against that. if you made money, awesome, i’m happy you did and i don’t blame you. but what i’m saying is that clov isn’t near the potential of amc or gme. if we hold and buy more, we are in for a fucking hailstorm of tendies because of how much shares are owed. $16 stock price will hurt them but $40 stock price will ruin them. and i’m coming from a place where i want to see clov at amc levels before we migrate to the next short, why? because as long as we hold and take profits to fulfill another short, they will bleed. and that’s what need. too 3 shorted stocks of all time at current time. amc, gme and clov. why wouldn’t you buy the next $250 stock or even at its worst, the next $45 dollar stock. not financial advice. if you clown face me, i’m assuming you’re a citadel bot. or just down right retarded.",-2
3,"i'll keep this short: you can read about bbby's new management, etc elsewhere. this dd covers just 3 points. i've compared bbby with its main competitors: target (tgt), gap (gps), and walmart (wmt). 1. huge short interest as % float. in bbby, it's 32%. that's a shit-ton of bananas if this thing pops. keep in mind, that's just the official percentage. we all remember how gme was supposedly not being shorted anymore, right? 🤡 here is the short as % of float in bbby's competitors: gap = 6% tgt = 2% wmt = 1% 2. forward-looking p/e. now, i know division requires more toes and fingers than you've got (you might have to use your wife's boyfriend's), but take my word for it: forward-looking price/earnings ratio is a pretty fucking big deal. the lower it is, the more reasonably the stonk is priced. with bbby, it's 16. with its competitors: gap = 14 tgt = 19 wmt = 22 3. last but not least, fucking cramer... i know he's an amoral piece of shit manipulator with access to tens of millions of boomers. i know he tried to fuck us over on gme and other stonks waaaay too many times. but at the same time, he's pumping up bbby like there's no tomorrow. did you know that bb spiked up from $8 on zero actual news? the catalyst (that's a thing that makes a rocket go boom) was some cnbc guest quickly saying he had some bb calls. the whole thing was just 10 seconds long, but it set off a spike to $10, and the rest was history. if a simple 10-second segment can do that to a grotesquely over-shorted stonk... all i'm saying is that i anticipate a boomer stampede to bbby sooner rather than later. and that's it - plain and simple. here, have a banana for making it this far: 🍌 hell, actually have 10 bananas. 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 🍌 full disclosure: i am an ape. 🦍 this is purely for entertainment purposes. also, rockets. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀",-2
4,"we need to understand that our victory is guaranteed as long as we hold. hedge funds can only win if they break us psychologically and make us sell. we definitely win if we hold, but they have to hope we sell to win. understand this! the tricks they pull are: 1) make you buy other stuff - distraction with other “recommended” stocks to reduce buying power in amc and gme 2) prevent you from buying - use news to say amc and gme are dangerous (“analysts” against them) 3) reduce price - short attacking amc and gme stocks to reduce price (but they can’t do this unlimited) 4) manipulate data - create a fake appearance that they’re covering there may be other ways they’re manipulating, but stop falling for them! the fact is, you don’t have to do anything other than buy and hold. really. it’s that simple.",-2

9,"yesterday's action on wwe scared the living shit out of me. i mean, how the fuck does one dd on wsb cause a $4.4b stock to move up 11% (~$450m in market cap)? clearly something must be wrong with the market, right?! here's some fun [math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msdunzyyaiq#t=41) for you: wwe's iv was 35%. the standard deviation for a daily move (using the rule of 16) is 35/16 = 2.1875%. it moved 11%/2.1875% -- about *five* standard deviations. the odds of that? roughly 1 in 1.74 million. (let me know if this is miscalculated). so how does a 1 in 1.74 million event occur? and, more practically: why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price? # the smell - high bang for the buck if you remember my [first post yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsogs/comments/nvibpi/wwe_can_you_smell_what_the_stock_is_cooking/), i chose this ticker due to it passing the smell test: * **s**hort interest is high * **m**arket cap is high * **e**xtremely memeable * **l**ow iv &lt;-- (implies low volume, as well) * **l**ow float what differentiates wwe from other new meme stocks (clov, clne, etc) are the low iv and low volume. i'll touch on that in a sec. first, let's get one thing straight. the bump from yesterday was **definitely** from my original post. to me that's incredible... because i don't even consider that post a wild success: * it didn't hit the frontpage. * it was buried a few pages deep for awhile (it got a late start). * in the end, it garnered 1k upvotes and 230 comments. * wwe reached something like #25 in mentions on wsb. meh. * **yet, still, caused a *five sigma* move in the stock.** that's pretty good leverage. i think that's the smell at work -- particularly the low iv and low volume. there's just not much liquidity in this stock. not much of the market cares about it. if they did, then after settling down at $65.00, with volume tapering off.. where were the profit takers? where were the shorts? **a 10% day with *zero* news, and momentum seemingly fading... and it stays at +10% five sigma levels?** with a single 1k upvote wsb post? i'm bullish. # show me the memes now do me a favor and find some second-generation meme stocks with dd-post numbers that low that have done *anything*. seriously, i'd be grateful if you find one. i don't think any stock has moved 11%, much less five sigma of its iv, from a single dd before. (well, maybe clne. but it wasn't five sigma, and it was already widely discussed recently before the run-up. i could be wrong here.) a more typical example: clf, a new star, a had *several* dd posts yesterday, all raking in *multiple times* the amount of upvotes and comments. and what did clf do yesterday? up 14%. with an iv of 60%, a 14% move is 3.2 standard deviations away, or 1 in 1000 odds. all of that attention and it breaks out by an amount 1000x more likely than what happened to wwe. **wwe got far less attention, but moved a much more significant amount.** see what i'm saying? also yesterday, the other second-generation meme tickers were fetching in tens of thousands of upvotes across several posts. they seemed to just hang out. some dumped. meanwhile, wwe just hangs out even while the wsb ""trend"" ranking is like [#26](https://www.quiverquant.com/wallstreetbets/) on the rankings. (scroll down to ""trend map"" or ctrl+f for wwe). it's mentions count is *way down there* .. below crsr, bark, si, sdc, twnk, and a bunch of other shit i had no idea anybody still cared about or just started fawning over. **and, yet, wwe pumped and did not dump.** &gt; why didn't it close at a lower, more statistically reasonable price? i believe there is simply not much real inflows or outflows in wwe. remember, the daily volume on this was generally very low, the iv was very low, and it's 120% insitutionally owned. nobody trades this, it's not expected to move much, and the shareholders are boomer funds. how many of those institutional owners actually reposition their holdings regularly? i don't think many. at least, not many did yesterday. the wsb post started reaching obscurity, but wwe held steady at 11% gains -- with literally *no fundamentals* changing from day before. the shorts are being cautious, and the longs are just chilling. **if you believe that my one shitty little post was enough for what happened yesterday, then you should see that it doesn't take much to move this stock.** with wwes meme potential, and it being short squeeze season, there's a lot of upside, and not a whole lot of downside (maybe -11%, back down to where it was). # news porn this type of coverage can't hurt: - bloomberg: [newest meme stocks extend gains with no sign of craze fading](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-09/newest-meme-stocks-extend-gains-as-craze-shows-no-sign-of-fading) - motley fool: [why wwe sotck jumped 21.5% today](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/09/why-wwe-stock-jumped-215-today/) - sbnation: [wwe stock could be getting the gamestop treatment](https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2021/6/9/22526765/wwe-memestock-reddit-share-prices-surge) - i got mentioned by name lol - investor's business daily: [meme-mania sends wwe stock flying as amc is slammed](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-slips-meme-mania-sends-wwe-stock-flying-amc-stock-slammed-microsoft-gains/) admittedly surreal to see these. # the squeeze is not squoze in case any of you are into this for the squeeze potential - 22% of available float - let's discuss. if you don't care about sqeeziness, great, you can skip this. i don't believe we saw any squeeze yesterday: * post market and pre market shows extremely bullish activity. * mms and quant algos see an uptick in wwe mentions on ""the bane of our existance"" * asks for options go up defensively * market opens, and plethora of options orders come in. (not a crazy amount, just 1k upvotes worth). they continually hit the ask and ramp up the volatility. * mms are forced to gobble up shares to deltahedge from both the new options, and also the *huge* gap at open, and also the *huge* increase in iv. remember, based on the prices they've sold the existing oi, this is a *five sigma* event. * on a stock with hardly any volume to support that. * stock wobbles around as the feeding frenzy ensues * volumes tapers down, stock holds at +10% no hockey stick squeeze. no high volume spikes mid day. thus, i think no margin calls and no covering. **furthermore, i'm told ortex did not show a decrease in shares on loan.** i'll update this tomorrow when that data becomes available. # conclusion it is my opinion that non-retail longs and shorts are just sitting on the sidelines. not much profit taking, not much shorting, and not much covering. they're all being cautious. look at institutional ownership of this thing. **120%.** how many of these fund managers are going to reposition their wwe holdings mid-day? probably not many. i feel like yesterday's movement was all us, mms, and hfts shuffling. just from one itty bitty 1k upvote post. that's a lot of leverage. the smell in real. what happens if this post hits 2k? or this thing gets memed by others? what happens if shorts actually start to cover? what happens if there's an acquisition? *but don't kid yourself... this is still speculative.* i'm now *less* bullish, but not bearish, about: * a fundamentals based justification of current share price. i'm now *more* bullish about: * the impact that visibility here could have on the share price. * the probability of shorts covering, probably slowly for now, but possibly biting the bullet if we get into the $70s. * the iv getting more jacked (90% iv is high for this ticker, but low for a meme-stock) and, lastly, when this thing peaked just after open and you all complained about not getting in: well, [i felt ugly. i felt stupid. i felt gay.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_do8vgy4bqi&amp;t=50s) sorry about that. my next dd, if i find another smelly stock, will be during market hours. # tldr * i'm bullish that a single 1k-upvoted dd on wsb, reaching only #25 most mentioned, was able to move this stock 11% up (+$440m to market cap)... which @ 35% iv is a five sigma event. about 1 in 1.7 million. * by comparison, clf had several posts each with ~3k upvotes, 3x the comments, etc, and it saw a 14% move. that's 3.2 sigma move, about 1 in 1000. * to me that indicates there is not much liquidity in wwe, and the volume yesterday was mms, hfts, quant funds, and retail buying options and shares. * 120% institutional ownership must have a lot of float locked up as well, and they're not in the business of repositioning randomly on a bump with no news. * price **held** at +11% -- five sigma above what the market thought this was valued at a day ago, despite no news. why no sell-off? * again -- all this from a single *moderately successful* post. * to me this reads as bullish: the small visibility on wsbs has a massive impact on the share price. more massive than any other tickers i've seen catch on here lately. * i saw no signs of covering or margin calls. neither did ortex. # positions after yesterday's action, the risk/reward for options is significantly higher. i don't think the ivs are too crazy, yet, but the odds of a 20-bagger are slim unless we see clf levels of hype. regardless, i trimmed most of my options, and have left in the $-amount i started with. same positions as before, but now evenly spread: * jun 18 $65, $70 * jul 16 $60, $65, $70 * jan '22 $60 * if this post picks up traction i'll be adding onto the 70s at open. * i will likely buy many shares at open, as i think the worst case with them is they go down 11% to $58. no biggie.",-2

11,"hedge funds are using the oldest war tactic - divide and conquer. paid articles and tweets ""here's the next gme"", ""list of the most shorted stocks"", etc. are all over the place. why now? because they are afraid and because apes are strong together. when we concentrate in a few stocks, we win. when we split, we lose. it's like a horror movie scenario when a group of young students enter a scary place and immediately split into smaller groups - huge mistake! it's a lot easier for hedge funds to defeat us one by one: * distracting apes from $gme and $amc = less money going to these names thus fewer chances of short squeeze (good for hedge funds) * beating apes at new meme stocks pump &amp; dump games = stealing money from apes so they can buy back those shorted shares with your money, lowering your purchasing power, causing anger among apes, ape nation civil war (good for hedge funds) * spreading fud via media, social networks = apes get distracted, demotivated, lower morale, fight against each other (good for hedge funds) do not sell $gme and $amc, buy more if you can, every share counts and hold. apes are strong together. there are thousands of possible new short candidates as i write this and i'm not saying we shouldn't look for next one but not at this moment. just like in a typical war the more new fronts you open the more chances you will lose. don't chase every meme stock mentioned on wsb, hedge funds usually have positions in those stocks and you are helping them. stop right now! apes strong together!",-2

14,"first let me start out by saying i'm an ape who eats crayons but had to post this because this spot right here is the biggest, rarest, and last opportunity we apes have to buy in at these cheap prices. wallstbets know that if they let gme drop, from this spot here, the entire meme frenzy will die. this is 100% the next rip. also, i absolutely hate fundamentals but this isn't a play based on that, but rather based on the momentum. old heads don't see that and are still buying shares of the dow on their quotrons. now, let's look at the technicals. here's where shit gets interesting... **price action** first off, we need to analyze the price action of gme and right off the bat we see a massive gap right at $305. short sellers came in right at the $350 mark and beat it down because if it blew the top off this daily resistance at $326-350, we will absolutely moonshot to $400+. that is if however we transition from these irrelevant clov and bb stocks and roll over our gains into gme. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/jpo9521b6o471.png?width=1048&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=87f7400664a94226b38f8a05473aedfa4c5732b2 also, rsi starting to taper. historically gme has sold off after every earnings call for the past two years so i'm not surprised to see a dip right here. the thing is however that gme absolutely crushed earnings. the previous gap at $210 just filled and we needed that in order to make a higher low. **fibs** this spot right here is the single greatest fib retracement i have ever seen. hovering right at .618 otherwise known as the ""golden trade"". the support level we are bouncing off is in line with the fib levels almost to a t, so we can expect a reversal is coming. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/lzanblgd6o471.png?width=2966&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00a00856592e36dd8117faeec6d5d2defc56a5f6 **option vol** now the icing on the cake is the option volatility that is absolutely sky rocketing. you can see the slight dip in call vol when we had the fat dip and see it start to pick up when we hit the golden fib ratio and set the gap at 310. let's also look at the put volatility which has been linear. this is due to the hedge funds shorting the fuck out of this stock doing everything they can not to let the redditors and tards win. options contracts are expiring on friday and are being rolled over, so on monday we will see a new wave of price fluctuation and option pricing where the contracts for next week will begin to drop. if my theory is correct, more buyers will jump in at the cheaper call prices when gme is pumped on market open on monday when it starts looking to fill the $310 gap. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/ddyujvsf6o471.png?width=3554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=61100491a89df316ba04aa8814d94fe9c1695138 **pc ratio** put call ratios look overall bullish and this call option right here stands out. a $4,000,000 call in july? that's big money and while these big institutions are shorting, the smaller guys and smaller firms are pouring money in. you can see that there are a couple of multi-million dollar call spreads and naked calls. the problem here is that your average tard doesn't have $3000+ for a naked call so that's why cheaper contracts will fill the gap. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/d33w9csi6o471.png?width=3554&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c6a5cfbbd65b91f320a5577194e229b049ca6d48 if you believe in the technical analysis and the fuck fundamentals revolution of stocks happening right now, this could be the biggest trade of the year. wallstbets is an organization that i believe will not go down without a fight, and i see them planning a massive rally with gme through their instagram and twitter pages. what you apes don't understand is that there is a hierarchy to everything, and the organizers of wallstbets are absolutely banking on the shit that is ripping. a lot of the retards buying can barely navigate this subreddit and see ""buy gme cannot go tits up"" on the front page and just let er rip with a $500 call on their robinhood account expiring next week. at the end of the day, do your own due diligence. the stock is cheap right now and i'm definitely buying. i believe in wallstbets and i think this is only the beginning of the meme stock revolution, and that these events will be engraved in financial history. this cannot go tits up ;) not financial advice don't wanna get sued. i'm gonna go back to eating crayons now since my lunch at arby's is almost over.",-2

20,"dear apes and autists, i want to talk about that four-letter word we all know and use frequently, whether it be consciously or subconsciously. risk &lt;-four letters; not the word you were thinking of right? fundamentally, risk is a life philosophy and how we each measure the potential for reward vs penalty. (blah, blah, google stuff, theory on decision analysis, statistics and practical examples) here's my simplified version: **risk: four tenets for a four letter word** 1. **live another day**. (lesson from wreck and cavern diving) don't go in so deep you can't make it out when everything goes wrong. same applies to depth and (lack of) diversity of investing plays. someone asked in r/thetagang about what to do with 100 naked calls they sold that are now itm. others yolo their tuition /rent /mortgage /savings /medicine money. don't do this. [i’m dumb and feel so hopeless. never sell naked calls. my 100k loss turned into over 600k in minutes with amc. i’m not even sure how i can recover from this. : thetagang (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/nqy5nk/im_dumb_and_feel_so_hopeless_never_sell_naked/) 2. **have a plan. (aka exit strategy)** (military maxims) ""failure to plan is to plan to fail."" ""a plan is a baseline for change."" this is about figuring out ahead of time what your personal exit points are. there was a guy one weekend on wsb holding options up 3000% and wondering if he should sell some. 3. **call it off when it's going wrong**. (diving, trail riding). this is not a life or death mission. if it's a bad day and things are going screwy, recognize it, and call it early, rather than late. have a beer and talk about what might have been...do not ""double down"". (like i did when clov was being suppressed in may, but i was on hopium, so i bought more calls, and they all became worthless.) 4. **recognize how little you know.** (every sport, hobby, and pastime) the world is full of excited, happy hobbyists! people who know a lot about subject are experts and usually do it for a living. experts can recognize the limits of their own knowledge, unusual situations, and unashamedly seek counsel from trusted peers. hubris is a common character flaw in greek tragedy plays. be aware of your own limitations; there's no deus ex machinas out here! seek advice before you get into trouble! there a bunch more i could have added, but i know there's some awesome experience and brainpower lurking on various subs (and yes, even here) who can add what the average investing hobbyist should look for under one of these four headings. resources: [options strategies | learn to trade options - the options playbook](https://www.optionsplaybook.com/) investopedia, youtube recognize that you will make mistakes, and that the market can move in mysterious ways. have a plan to get above water. and may your tendies be hot and crisp. cheers! lp",-2

[https://www.psytoolkit.org/c/3.3.2/survey?s=frtoa](https://www.psytoolkit.org/c/3.3.2/survey?s=frtoa) &amp;#x200b; **theoretical background** “homo economicus', the economical man, is a hypothetical individual who always acts in their own rational self-interest. this hypothetical individual was first advocated by john stuart mill and though it has come under increasing fire in recent years it remains a central pillar of many neoclassical financial theories (thaler, 2000). and yet when one reads the discourse surrounding $gme, homo economicus has disappeared. to understand the absence of homo economicus, as far as it is related to $gme, we must first address the limitations imposed by the human organism on rationality and reason as well as the role that communities have in the construction of knowledge, representations, and reality itself. with that we can then examine the series of events that led to a divergence in the perceptions of what was reasonable, rational, and logical between the mainstream media and pundits and the wsb community. when discussing homo economics and the idea of absolute rationality it behoves us to refer to one of its earliest critics: herbert simon. according to simon there are two main conditions that must be met for a decision to be rational, and by extension logical and reasonable. the first condition is that the individual has to have options from which to choose and has to be able to evaluate and establish the value of the consequences which stem from any one choice. the individual must then be able to rank the consequences and choose the one with is most preferred (simon, 1955). the second condition that must be met follows from the first and is that of perfect knowledge. for a decision to be truly rational a person must have a complete and total understanding of, at the very least, all their options and all the ensuing consequences. this is impossible for two reasons: cognitive limitations, of which there are two, and an incomplete awareness of one’s options (simon, 1955). the first limitation stems from our inability to process, absorb, and comprehend an infinite amount of data even if we were to acquire such knowledge in the first place. the second cognitive limitation arises from our biases, unconscious or preconscious thoughts, and emotions which colour our evaluations of the hypothetical consequences of our decisions (clore, 2011). this is especially true when we receive information which concerns a group we relate to or are a member of (bangerter, 1995). while cognitive limitations could, in theory, be compensated for by algorithms that provide bias and emotion free evaluations, the limitations imposed by an incomplete understanding of solutions to a given problem cannot. simply put, it is rare that we have every possible option in front of us at the same time in a dynamic organic situation. what follows is the conclusion that rationality is limited: constrained by our cognition and by the dynamism of human interaction. consequently, a rational decision is rarely what turns out to be the absolute best choice in the long run but often the least-worst or most acceptable option presented to us at the time the decision is made. further complicating the nature of rationality is that any decision can be defined as rational, by both the person or group making the decision and by outside observers witnessing the event. under normal circumstances groups will share the same or similar understandings and representations of an object or concept and, consequently, largely agree on what constitutes a reasonable and rational course of action. if however the groups differ in their understanding and representation of a given object or concept there will be a difference in what one group perceives as a rational and reasonable course of action. the differences in rationality-perception between groups arises due to the socially constructed nature of knowledge. any information we receive is filtered by our biases and then invariably developed by interaction with group members before being integrated into our cognition (wagner et al., 1999). consequently, what enters our cognition is not necessarily an objective fact but rather a representation of the information we have received. given that these representations are developed by social interaction we can see that what is colloquially referred to as reality is a series of cognitive representations upon which all members of a given group agree. the concept of bounded rationality can be said then to be influenced by socially constructed knowledge in that our evaluation of our options and consequences are affected by our group membership and the prevailing narrative of our group. as such, a reasonable and rational course of action is one that provides the most benefit for an individual where benefit is determined by self-interest which in turn is influenced by group membership. furthermore, given that internal representations of objects and concepts are inextricably linked to the people we socialize with, a rational choice must be considered from the perspective of a given individual’s social sphere. in the investment world, this socialization applies to both retail (individuals who invest on their own behalf) and institutional investors (companies or organizations that manage investments on others’ behalf). both of these groups share three main high-level representations to which all analytic research is reduced: buy, hold, or sell (grant, 2020). furthermore, due to government regulation against insider trading, and collusion more broadly, an expert’s representation of a stock is public knowledge which, in theory, allows every member of the ‘investor’ group access to the same information at the same time. under normal circumstances a retail investor will consult experts who provide them with their representation of a stock. the retail investor then either accepts the expert's representation, internalizes it, and acts upon it or rejects it in favour of a different representation which was generally another mainstream pundit. either way the quantity of shares a retail investor holds is either increased (buy representation), remains the same (hold representation), or is reduced (sell representation). retail investors typically traded with both informational and temporal disadvantages compared to institutional investors (aramonte &amp; avalos, 2021). they have also been found to trade more frequently and with greater appetite for risk, due to faulty assessment, than their institutional counterparts (aramonte &amp; avalos, 2021) (montier, 2002). the lack of coordination imposed by technology, a lack of centralization, and small uncoordinated trades meant that retail investors were generally incapable of moving markets, due to their small uncoordinated trades. this led institutional investors to conclude that retail investors were rational and reasonable individuals and therefore representative of the hypothetical homo economicus. representational unity was further maintained by the monopoly on information enjoyed by pundits and institutions. given that retail investors traded at a disadvantage, they often aped the moves of institutions and since both groups were engaging in similar patterns of behaviour the belief in mutual rationality and reasonability was justified. as the internet has matured and social media developed, historical limitations and disadvantages have shrunk significantly. retail investors are now capable of accessing stock information from anywhere at almost any time and the formation of retail-investor communities, some of which have over 10 million members, has made it possible for them to communicate on a grand scale. furthermore, these communities meant that retail investors no longer derived their representations solely from institutional experts but could also begin to rely on information provided by ingroup members who had positioned themselves as experts. so long as the two groups’, in this case institutional and retail investors, experts shared similar representations neither the mainstream nor the special interest retail investment communities saw the other as irrational, unreasonable, or in violation of established norms. that is not to say that there was no hostility between retail and institutional investors. the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis and the subsequent recession and government bailouts of financial institutions amplified existing divisions between retail and institutional investors and severely damaged consumer confidence in those self-same institutions (mccarthy, 2021 and bowman, 2018). the 2008 financial crisis also caused heavy individual losses for retail investors who generally regarded the government bailouts as unfair. the result of these combined factors was the formation of narratives which regarded institutional investors as hostile actors who benefited from unfair rules and regulations. thus, the internal representation of financial institutions changed from what could be considered indifference to impotent anger and resentment: the individual retail investor may have wanted to punish the institutional investor but they lacked the ability to do so. financial institutions were simply too robust to be brought down by the decentralized movements of the time. the slow formation of retail investor communities, the rise of retail experts, a clear leadership structure in the form of community moderators which could facilitate a rapid shift in representation among the rank-and-file members of the community (satherley et al., 2018) and a central narrative to allow the formation of targeted movements (davis, 2002, chapter 1) laid the foundation for unprecedented retail investor driven market volatility. the only missing component was a suitable target. in late-2020 retail investors realized that a hedge fund had shorted massive quantities of $gme leaving them exposed to a sudden rise in the stock price: a suitable target had been found. this prompted the transformation of long simmering resentment into directed action. driven by a fundamental change in the community’s representation of $gme, the wsb community purchased vast quantities of the stock driving up the price to a peak of over 500 usd, up from a december 1st price of 15.80 usd, triggering billions of dollars in losses for hedge funds and driving some into insolvency due to the subsequent short squeeze. members of the wsb community have continued to hold onto $gme in anticipation of an even larger short squeeze. &amp;#x200b; **methodology** to facilitate narrative analysis, i analyzed $gme ‘megathreads’ between january 22nd to february 4th. each megathread was a place for discussion solely about $gme and over the course of those 14 days (of which 4 were weekends and therefore no trading was taking place) 7 days had dedicated megathreads with each day averaging 2 megathreads for a total of 14. reddit imposes a comment limit of 100 thousand comments per thread, given that there were days with overflow we can assume that there were somewhere between 750 thousand to about 1 million comments made on these threads alone. for that reason, it was decided that the megathreads alone would be adequate to analyze the narrative. additionally, the most popular memes relating to $gme were extracted and analyzed to provide a point of comparison. to facilitate a search through the threads they were sorted by both “top” and by “controversial” to gauge both mainstream community narratives and the more controversial deviant narratives. 224 comments and 10 memes were selected due to their roles as exemplars of the broader conversation within the wsb community. reddit is a public forum which requires users to take on screen names which preserves anonymity and as a public forum consent is not needed before posts are analyzed. as such it was not necessary to secure consent or perform any additional checks as they relate to ethical or legal obligations. that being said, screen names have been redacted to comply with the broader culture of the community that was being analyzed. **coding structure** each post was coded along 7 criteria: sentiment, content, function, group/movement expression, conformative buy-in, persecution, expression of a hostile narrative towards institutional investors (see appendix table 1). sentiment was subdivided into one of three categories: bullish, neutral, or bearish. posts were coded as bullish if it suggested positive sentiment either explicitly or via in-group iconography such as rockets, moons, or expressions of the same. neutral if they expressed no strong opinion either way, and bearish if the post expressed a lack of faith or negative opinion (see appendix coding 1-3). content was subdivided into two subcodes: serious or humorous. given the online environment and nature of the community, a content code was deemed more effective than tone because even serious posts rarely had a serious tone (see appendix coding 2 and 3). function was subdivided into four subcodes: hype, inform, warn/caution, solidarity. hype posts were those that sought to promote the purchase of $gme and encourage group members to buy more or posts which were exuberant and expressed extreme confidence in the rising price of $gme. inform is coded to those posts which sought to convey information to the community about the stock, the market, or relevant political or social developments. warn/caution posts existed to warn group members about some danger, risk, or potential situation, or urged caution vis-a-vis expectations and timelines. solidarity was coded to posts which expressed sympathy for, or empathy towards group members who either bought stock on a daily high and were therefore ‘left behind’ or towards the personal situations of group members. it should be noted that posts could belong to one, some, or all of these categories (see appendix coding 4-6). group/movement expression refers to posts which either used the first-person plural ‘we’ as opposed to the singular ‘i’ as is common in retail-investment posts or posts which used in-group iconography such as ape emojis or expressions of the same such as “ape together strong”. posts which explicitly referred to the idea of a movement were obviously coded as such (see appendix coding 6) conformative buy-in refers to posts which expressed an initial reluctance to purchase stock but that the individual purchased it due to group pressure or those posts which expressed that an individual was only buying because everyone else was. this also includes variants of posts with the text stating that the original poster would purchase stock if they got a certain number of upvotes (see appendix coding 7) persecution posts were coded as those which referenced, explicitly or conspiratorially, activities which the original poster deemed to be unfair or hostile towards retail investors as a whole or the wallstreetbets community in particular (see appendix coding 5). hostile narrative posts contain either overt hostility towards financial institutions, reference the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, or express a desire to take revenge on or punish financial institutions or institutional investors (see appendix coding 7). &amp;#x200b; **results** &amp;#x200b; **sentiment** of the 224 posts, 143 expressed bullish sentiment, 75 either an unclear or neutral sentiment, and 6 expressed a bearish sentiment. it should be noted that the neutral posts also included those in which the author never explicitly indicated their position either in text or via symbolism (rockets, moons, apes, bananas). given that, it is likely that the number would change in the favour of “bullish sentiment” given that many of the neutral posts were conveying information. additionally, bearish sentiment was found on 01.02 and was posted by people who had bought the stock at peaks and were therefore poised to lose money, and on 04.02 when the price had collapsed to 53.50 usd. **content** with regards to content, 180 posts contained serious messages while 44 were purely jokes with the ratio of serious to jokes remaining relatively stable at 85:15. exceptions were noted on the 26.01 and 04.02 which both saw almost one third of posts being purely humorous. it should be noted however that the tone was vastly different with the jokes on the 26th being considerably more upbeat while those on the 4th consisted of much darker gallows humour. &amp;#x200b; **functionality** functionality was a more difficult category to code due to the potential of a post to have multiple intentions. often the “inform” code occurred alongside “hype” (r(informxhype) = .63, p = 0.066) or “warn/caution” (r(informxwarn/caution) = 0.955, p = &lt;0.01). furthermore, there were posts which were simple statements and thus did not have a suitable code and were, for that reason, excluded. the most common code was “hype” posts with 44% of all posts expressing confidence, excitement, or urging others to purchase stock. “inform” was the second most common accounting for 36% of all posts while “warn/caution” and “solidarity” accounted for 21% and 18% respectively. “hype” and “inform” were the first and second most common respectively on all days except the 28th and the 4th. on the 28th there were issues with trading apps restricting the purchase of $gme which resulted in a massive spike in the number of posts containing some group relevant information (74% of total posts). this day also saw a significant increase in the number of posts containing sentiments expressing unfairness of persecution: 47% compared to the megathread average of 22%. on the 4th the dominant expression was solidarity accounting for 44% of the posts. these posts while coded as solidarity were different from the previous days because they were not expressing solidarity with so-called “astronauts”, people who bought at peaks and were “left-behind” but can instead be best described as community members commiserating with one-another and lamenting the collapse of the stock price. furthermore, the number of posts both in absolute terms and as a proportion of the selected posts rose as time progressed rising from a nadir of 10% on january 26th to a peak of 44% on february 4th. posts coded with “warn/caution” fluctuated in frequency over the course of the seven analyzed megathreads but could generally be categorized as either warning community members not to sell their stock, generally combined with exhortations to hold, or cautioning community members against getting their hopes up and urging them to be patient. it is worth noting that there is a moderate correlation, albeit with a p-value above threshold though that may be due to the limited number of megathreads analyzed, between “warn/caution” codes and posts indicating “persecution” (r(warn/cautionxpersecution) = 0.54, p = 0.105). &amp;#x200b; **group/movement membership** posts containing references, either explicitly or implicitly by using the plural forms of language, to the concept of membership in a movement could be found in 67% of all posts and was included in more than 50% of posts on all analyzed megathreads except for 04.02 but even on that day such posts were included in 44% of the analyzed posts. group/movement membership containing posts correlated most strongly with “hype” (r = 0.96, p&lt;0.01) and warn (r = 0.76, p = 0.024). group/movement membership also showed a statistically significant correlation with posts coded to “inform” (r = 0.69, p = 0.042). &amp;#x200b; **conformative buy-in** post expressing conformative buy-in accounted for 17% of posts in total but reached their peak on the january 26th megathread at 26% before dropping off as time went one. it should be noted that of the 5 posts referring to conformative buy-in on the 1st of february 3 were individuals expressing “panic-buying” which is different from the “fuck it i’m in” attitude expressed in the first 3 megathreads. conformative buy-in (cbi) correlated most strongly with posts which also expressed “group/movement membership” (r = .88, p = 0.010) and those posts which also expressed a hostile narrative or invoked the spectre of the 2008 financial crisis (r = .93, p &lt; 0.001). conformative buy in was often expressed in one of three forms: people who were asking questions in the megathread and being convinced by the broader community, people who purchased stock due to the prevalence of $gme related conversations, and people who explicitly expressed a desire to punish or get revenge upon financial institutions and for whom $gme was the vehicle which facilitated the aforementioned desire. individual categories of cbi will be analyzed in detail in the discussion. &amp;#x200b; **persecution** posts referencing the unfairness of the financial system accounted for 22% of all analyzed posts. though initially relatively rare averaging 16% in the first 3 megathreads the instance of references towards persecution or unfairness skyrocketed to 47% the day trading apps restricted the purchase of $gme and remained elevated averaging 26% from the 29th until the 4th. interestingly there is no correlation between posts referencing persecution and expressing a hostile narrative. the only code to which persecution correlates is the “inform” code (r = 0.65, p = 0.056) and as mentioned above there is a tendential correlation to the warn code ( r = 0.54, p = 0.105). this does reflect the different the two main categories of unfairness towards retail investors: misinformation spread via bots and market manipulation due to restrictions on retail-investor trading. &amp;#x200b; **hostile narrative** posts expressing hostility towards financial institutions, institutional investors, government, or expressing a desire for vengeance or punishment accounted for 28% of posts. post expressing a hostile narrative were most frequent in the first week accounting for 30+% of all posts until the 28th at which point they dropped off to an average of 19% over the subsequent three megathreads. hostile narrative posts correlated strongly not only with cbi but also with group/movement membership (r = 0.76, p = 0.755) and hype ( r = 0.82, p = 0.012). expression of this hostile narrative can be subdivided into generalized anger at the perceived unfairness of the financial system or directly referenced the 2008 financial crisis. invocations of the 2008 financial crisis were less common but tended to receive more upvotes, attention, and responses, than more generalized expressions of anger.",-2

30,"tl;dr at bottom i’m extremely bullish on amc. in fact, more than i was back in late january and early february. the inflation rate, collateral issues, and reverse repos are all factors that lead me to believe that investors are inching ever so closer to creating heavy losses for hedge funds and short sellers. as you may be aware, during the amc shareholder count that occurred on june 2nd, ceo adam aaron stated retail investors comprise 80% of amc shares with each individual averaging about 120 shares each. as of 9am est this wednesday morning, amc has seen 1.76 million trades, and despite no new huge news, it’s already seeing a gradual decrease from yesterday’s close. so why are so many people selling? that’s the thing. i don’t think we are. earlier this morning, jim cramer commented on amc’s price action in a [tweet](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1405138423741100033): “meme people amc is down…. i think it’s time to burst in.” now this is entirely speculation on my part, but i believe that this could be serving as a cover for a short ladder attack, which is something that many gme, amc, and other tickers are familiar with. that being said, i do expect the rest of today and this trading week to be rather ugly. however, no one said that a ride to the moon would be a smooth one. in the past 5 months alone, retail investors have caused billions of dollars worth of losses to hedge funds and overall people that want to screw over working class people. in fact, this past monday (the 14th), when amc surged 15%, it caused over $515 million worth of losses. this is chump change compared to some of the other numbers we’ve seen, but they add up. another interesting piece of information i learned is that recent reports showed that amc is the most traded stock on fidelity and freetrade, and the 3rd most traded stock on robinhood. just take look below. &amp;amp;amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/1agt5p2p0n571.png?width=1495&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=2ca6fcbd7807333102d8674635b8851cb175d979 &amp;amp;amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/ykdc6hmq0n571.jpg?width=1408&amp;amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=1d81f7f5ca89f3b3ed5b7b8c4c342a03a068ddbd i personally dislike the motely fool, but it allowed me to view information provided by robinhood. as you can see, sentiment for amc remains high across multiple brokerages. &amp;amp;amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/ji7s761s0n571.png?width=1940&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=3d5937d5adab17070ada855f0ec8beb31a600bf8 as of june 2nd, amc has managed to remain above $42.72 and this has continued for two whole weeks! this has resulted in devastating losses for short sellers. it went as far as touching $70 just two weeks ago. and although it is currently in the mid-50’s range, i believe that bullish sentiment from traders will allow it to continue to climb even in the face of short ladder attacks. according to the data on webull, amc has seen more large-scale orders recently. this might be due to the amount of options expiring this friday, the 18th. down below, i’ve listed the large-scale buy orders placed and executed in the last 5 trading days: 6/09: $1,829,580 6/10: $4,826,810 6/11: $6,961,840 6/14: $5,458,670 6/15: $9,946,860 mind you, this is the net value of all large-scale orders that were placed those days. in other words, it took the difference from all the large-scale buys as well as the large-scale sells. the final numbers for all of those dates came out to a positive number, meaning there were more buys than sells. that doesn’t even take into account people buying from rh, etrade, fidelity, etc. needless to say, buying pressure is immense right now, which may the reason there has been an increase of fud, shills, and bots trying to direct people away from amc and into other tickers and ultimately tricking them into losing their money into a pump and dump. in terms of good news, amc is currently poised to become the dominant movie theatre chain in l.a., which would include two shopping mall locations. with both tourists and locals visiting during the summer, and with more and more americans receiving the vaccine and the desire to return to normal coming along with it, it wouldn’t be a surprise to see significant increases in revenue as time goes on. this change might not be an immediate one, of course, but it does force investors to consider the long-term plays that come with it. short sellers can’t hold forever, but investors can. short interest will slowly eat away at them and one day, as we all know, they’ll be forced to cover. when this happens, it’ll be every man for himself. seeing as to how many of us control the stock, though, we could, in theory, just not sell, which would cause an unprecedented rise in stock price. it should be common sense by now that we know that this cannot be accomplished by a single individual, hence the phrase: “apes together strong.” 🦍💪 tl;dr i feel as though bitch boy cramer and his ass-kissing gay bear friends are working extra hard to get people to paper-hand. he wants our bananas, but i refuse to give it to him. i think there are plenty of catalysts that not only make the current price sustainable, but on the verge of further increasing. as always, i’m not a financial advisor. do your own research before making any investment decisions. i just like the stock. amc to the moon, my friends 🚀🌕",-2
31,"that's exactly how the hedge fund run media outlets were printing across the internet!!! you even see many bear commenters saying this across the reddit board to scare everyone. here's an example of one of the fake media outlets saying ford dropped qnx [ford drops qnx](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-sync-google-android-blackberry-qnx-infotainment/) **the truth is.....no, ford did nottt drop blackberry qnx!!!!! they switched to qnx hypervisor** each car has 100 electrical control unit (ecu) performing all the smart functions from automatic brake to rear view camera to seat belt checks to acceleration to lane change etc....blah blah blah. **one of hundred ecu runs the infotainment of the car**. the infotainment is the unit used to change your music radio etc...the non critical and safety function of the car. so if infotainment craps out while driving no one will get hurt or die. ford essentially is dropping blackberry qnx to go with google android. but, remember car companies are consolidating ecu to reduce number of chips they need, so ford instead is using blackberry qnx hypervisor on the chip and running android on top. the hypervisor runs the infotainment(fm/am radio etc) and the instrument cluster(speed gauge....critical stuff). blackberry qnx hypervisor ([here](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-hypervisor)) lets you run non-critical (google android) and critical (qnx for cluster) on the same chip!!! essentially ford is paying more to use blackberry hypervisor. they chose this route becuase they don't want to continue developing the infotainment portion in-house due to cost. they're out sourcing it to google...this is a non-critical function inside the car that no one care if it fails. for everything else inside the car qnx is used extensively because it's the only asil-d certified software. &amp;#x200b; google and blackberry are working together for this infotainment portion. if you read this article it specifically refers to hypervisor. basically android will be running on bb qnx hypervisor!!! you can't run cars on android!!! every piece of critical ecu inside the car including the modem that connect to the internet is running blackberry qnx.

32,"cramer clearly has a pathological need to be liked by all. this is why he fawns all over money managers and ceos on tv while trashing the retail investor in the next breath. then he faux supports the small guy while throwing tiny bits of shade at the wealthy. he tries to ingratiate himself with all market cohorts (including santelli) because he sees himself as a beloved, unifying, peace making market icon. he fails to realize that it is exactly this duplicity and two-faced behavior that causes everyone to hate him. he acts as if he embraces the self-assigned title of 'most hated man', but it is clearly destroying his ego. his attitude towards the wsb crowd illustrates his desperate attempt at relevancy. he tries to explain wsb to the masses, but he cannot because he is too slow to follow them and lacks the credibility to lead them. one day, he tells them to stick to amc and gme. the next day he tells them to diversify away from those two stocks. it is sad to watch. jim, you will never be mark haines. his legacy was calling a market bottom during a crash on live television. yours will be telling millions of people to hold onto bear stearns stock as it became worthless, annoyingly childish sound effects and chasing the wsb crowd around like a lost puppy. rant over, please return to your regularly scheduled program.",-2

35,"a post went up this afternoon titled ""to clov or not to clov."" i spent 15 minutes typing a response and by the time i clicked submit, the post was taken down. this is the third time this week that's happened to me. it's quite bizarre how polarizing clover health stock has become, especially amongst r/wallstreetbets. it seems very few posts make it through the mod's iron curtain. there's so much scrutiny on the stock that if you head over to the r/clov subreddit you'll find an alarming number of accusations that the wsb mods have somehow been compromised by the short sellers of clov. compounding the issue, clover threads are rife with detractors of the stock proclaiming it to be nothing more than a hedge fund distraction. on the other side of the aisle, the community at r/clov is one of the fastest expanding among individual stock subreddits, growing at \~40% week over week and full of ardent supporters. i too am perplexed as to why the 5th most shorted stock on wall street (2nd among large cap companies) seems to remain so polarizing on both sides of the spectrum.

(fscomeau, i miss you) it's since evolved into a phenomenal portal of information for retail traders. wsb is a place where the common man, for once, has been able to punch back against hedge fund manipulation using the information generated by our 10 million plus degenerates. such claims against the mods are alarming. it's wrong to make any assumptions but what we can take a look at is the numbers. i searched for exclusive posts (not a megathread, daily mention or multi-ticker post) within the last 7 days by relevance between clov and amc. the result: clov: \~10 amc: 50+ there a couple reasons why this could be happening. most of the negative sentiment on clov posts stem from amc shareholders claiming that clov is a designed hf distraction from ""the prize"" of the amc or gme short squeeze. there are 2,800 companies traded on the nyse and i find that a rather bold proclamation but let's investigate. digging into the filings we find that citadel is ranked 22nd among *tutes by investment size* in clover health with 513,775 shares of 148,280,000 shares outstanding. a sound ape brain puts this at much less than 1% ownership the definitive number is 0.035%, significantly weakening this argument. citadel likely gives zero fucks what happens to clover health considering it's a \~$6.2m position for them. that's a fart in a whirlwind. [clov institutional holdings](https://preview.redd.it/zhydyln00h671.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ee23e4c971860ea82c0ef6eed6a2b9a76a45238a) well, joedirtbuffett, what else could be the problem? well mods could in fact be knowingly *or* unknowingly suppressing things outside of their agenda. perhaps they are still hyperfocused on gme &amp; amc and don't realize they're tamping down discussion of other tickers within the community. this would be counterintuitive to their own rules of not ""working as a collective."" but we have to look in the mirror when we notice that amc is getting 5:1 exposure over earnest discussions of other stocks. humans do operate under bias and not always intentionally. the clov side of the argument is, what if the mods have been infiltrated at wsb? some people are going to say ""that's some conspiracy theory shit"". but if jimmy chill has taught us anything, it's that hf's don't really give a damn about rules and will try to win at all costs. [jim cramer on market manipulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8djlogbrdca). in this example, ""two comma pauper"" gives a personal testimony on the ease at which he was able to infiltrate the media: [how writers are on the take](https://twitter.com/twocommapauper/status/1397106939193085952?s=21). with this in mind, how could the hf's *not* be trying to wield their influence here? this is modern warfare and reddit is the new battleground. all in all, it's something we need to be mindful and vigilant of. wsb started as and should remain a place where fair and equitable discussion of all stocks exists. i think as a collective we should always be aware of the threat of infiltration. we must hold mods to an high level of accountability but also be aware of high karma accounts shilling, brigading, silos of people working as a collective, bots and all the other things the mods are constantly working hard to protect us from.",-2

39,"first and foremost, i've been an apple customer since 2005. i like the ecosystem and have enjoyed apple products. recently, my cameras just random went out on my iphone 12 pro 512gb phone. ive been working with the apple support team after tmobile sent me there due to a warranty issue. so i chat with apple through support, they give me 3 options. self service, send in for repair or express replacement. i ask a lot of questions, because if i can go to a store (self service option) and get a new phone, it will be a lot faster than express replacement. (this issue is rather minute, yet when i researched how many people are having their cameras randomly fail on the iphone, i was really stunned). so i setup an appointment with apple to go get a new phone under warranty. the ""genius,"" at the genius bar informed me that apple has completely changed their service systems. instead of issuing replacement devices, they have to repair every single device. they have to fix it there and give it back, they're not in the business of replacement devices any more. i still don't believe this, but if it is indeed true. apple is screwd. here is why apple is screwed. after asking this guy a bunch of calibrated questions to get him to bend.. he really wouldn't. so i said fine, fix my cameras. but how can we get this done fast? i own a business and depend on my phone to help all of our flight crew. he looked me in the eye and said they don't have the parts and cannot get them for a while. i mentioned how i've seen hundreds of posts on reddit and elsewhere... people who have the same problem that i do. &amp;#x200b; why is it that apple cannot get replacement parts? is the supply chain that bad? when i see the scale of the issue by searching online, it really makes me wonder if apple has caused themselves a serious bottleneck. 1. they change service to repairs when possible dont' replace... 2. can't get replacement parts 3. leave people hanging. i know this seems like a hit piece on apple, but as i searched more and more. i realized i'm not jsut one guy with a broken iphone. i'm one guy of 10's of thousands who have a phone more expensive than a laptop and no way to fix it. while this may take months to showcase a real problem over time. it really makes me want to dig into the numbers at apple. no wonder why they are so after service revenue. no repairs. id rather just buy a blackberry and an itouch and get teh same experience. at least the price will match the expectations.",-2

41,"tldr: us, european and asian recoveries are all back. cushing stocks back to new lows. iran's elected a hardline president. momentum is coming in (along with very possible gamma push). domestic production crimped by lack of money. this is going to light a fire under crude. trades: xom (integrated), rrc (or any producer), uso (etf) if you have been forced back to work recently or been anywhere on the roads, you would have noticed the traffic has been getting worse. if you've been back to the airports, you'd feel that the terminals are packed again. but everyone has known that since feb of this year. what's changed? 1- cushing stocks are back at new lows. [eia link here](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/leafhandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=w_epc0_sax_ycuok_mbbl&amp;f=w). demand is damn strong. like everything in this market since 2020, once demand hits, there is a massive rush towards what little stock is left. think of agriculture, copper, memestonks. during the earlier part of the year, we've had pretty high stores as demand was still crimped. now in late june, stores are being rapidly depleted as refiners ramp up. we only really care about domestic demand with cushing. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/8ork7rip3p671.png?width=1448&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d04ab384c575348c87e7dc4404415cad1111e54 2- iran has elected a hardline president. that's it. stick a fork in the vienna deal. iran knows that its re-entrance into the world oil markets will be negative. it only cares about the amount of foreign currency it receives, not the number of barrels it exports. if it can continue exporting to asia if prices are 25% higher, it would rather do that than seeing crude prices decline and having to export more. the new president [has already issued a warning over the talks](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57552639), and will most likely continue to reinvigorate its national defense interests. this is the biggest change from a few weeks ago, as the past headwind (optimism for an iranian deal) has suddenly turned into a headwind. 3- momentum is coming in. yes, there is gamma squeeze in oil too. this is a snapshot of all /cl futures contracts. lots of volume coming in to the calls. same thing for oil companies, especially upstream/producers. iv on all oil related assets are relatively low (look at the current iv percentile for /cl) because it's been a slightly low rise in prices as we're still concerned about demand and iran. now that iran concern has been removed, it's back to a hot and wild summer. https://preview.redd.it/75ysc73k7p671.png?width=1383&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85d68e90c06d6e4b75f4bf260f1970942668a687 4- lack of drilling coming back online. the [bh rig count](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/baker-hughes-u.s.-rig-count-1652) is surprisingly low for this kind of rally and oil at $70. last time we were rallying to $70 levels (2010 and 2018) rig counts were were easily double where they are now. why the lack of drilling? simply there's no money going towards producers, especially the small marginal producers like 2 men with a truck. one of the main reasons is that there is no money. with all these funds going towards esg, what's left are handfuls of pe firms, many of which died in 2020. if the money doesn't flow, the oil doesn't flow. https://preview.redd.it/8hv1j8lb8p671.png?width=654&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=95fbd85c29c25e584ad1a2adf992d99d962d000b personally i've put a small $2k yolo in august 80c. let's see if i can't get a 10 bag from this. the entire cl chain is also very cheap... $100 dec are only a quarter. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/8u26fyv69p671.png?width=770&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c04a4c4e9745f811bb356ed65a9e80e77cfca9b",-2

45,"one fund has gone down because of the rise in gamestop share price. a london-based hedge fund that suffered losses betting against us retailer gamestop during the first meme stock rally in january is shutting its doors. white square capital, run by former paulson trader florian kronawitter, told investors that it would shut its main fund and return capital this month after a review of its business model, according to people familiar with the fund and a letter to investors. white square, which at its peak managed about $440m in assets, had bet against gamestop, say people familiar with its positioning, and suffered double-digit per cent losses in january. https://www.ft.com/content/397bdbe9-f257-4ca6-b600-1756804517b6",-2

(wasn’t as cool my bad). one last time for the mods. i am not telling anyone to pump up gme. i am saying what would happen if people who are individuals all bought into gme after wednesday or on the day the rule is implemented. now this is all headcannon except for the rule’s affect. there are gme apes that will correct me in the comments so sorry if i got anything wrong. not financial advice but these rules that have been proposed since the january debacle affect all institutions in the market.,-2

65,"find where they hide trying to take profits and prevent any attempt at a capital increase. fact, they have been using this particular stock as a piggybank for the past year. orchestrating wild swings to pull profits on both ends. while you buy and hold in a texas stand off, they work over side stocks like this one repeatedly replenishing their capital that is lost on the front line moon battle. i know of it because i am a long term investor who has watched this play out over the past year. i guarantee you there are other stocks they are playing this same game with. when gme or amc go up they loose capital, then they work over stocks like this one to replenish that capital. you guys have been in the gme battle for a year now and unless you adjust tactics, i believe shittadel and the other hedgies can put off the margin call forever. this stock needs nothing from this sub, my investment will rise on it's own accord naturally over the next 3-5 years and that is just fine with me. but some apes may want to consider figuring out how to stop the inflow of cash to these hedge funds. because unless you can cause a substantial capital decrease the margin call will never happen. as long as they have side stocks that are piggy banks the war will rage on. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/bqa301bqo7771.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=568168cca80a784ea8cb1446888675fd53b083b7",-2

73,"the hedgies want us to spend our money buying the options instead of the amc stock so that they will have less resistance as they short the stock price down. this way, both the amc share holders and the option holders lose. those hedgies are likely the ones selling you those call options. buying options is normally fine but in this battle against these corrupt shorts, if you spend your resources just buying the options, while thinking the amc stock price will magically rise without buying actual stock, you are fooling your self. this isn't like some biotech company coming out with a ground breaking drug or a ""tesla"" coming out with new innovations to drive their share price. amc share price will rise based on the demand of apes buying the actual stock. don't be a self serving, greedy tool and just buy options because they are cheaper and you can get more while depending on the rest of us to buy the stock up to make you money. actually, its your money so you can keep doing that but stop pretending to apart of the ape nation and stop being surprise that you keep losing money on your out of the money options. it's not getting to your strike price because there are not enough buyers to drive the share price up because you are not buying the stock!!!. there is no ""gamma squeeze"" if regular investors don't buy the actual stock to drive the price up, to force the brokers to hedge and buy stock. there is also no regular squeeze if we don't buy the actual stock. many of us have been playing right into the hedgies hands and some apes lose their money weekly in call options. even those that make money with options, unless they exercise their options, the brokers will unhedge and it drives the stock share price down. don't be an unconscious double agent as you are also sabotaging your self by reducing demand by not buying the actual stock. this could have already gone to the moon if all the wasted call options cash was spent on the actual stock. what would our ownership look like then? i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. this is my observation and my opinion that you stop being self serving, sabotaging mofos and that folks buy and hodl the amc stock if you like the movies, free popcorn and the company.",-2

77,"i posted this as a reply but wanted to hear your thoughts. the media and likely shitadel have been pumping fud and ""other"" stocks as the next ""meme stock"" and next ""big squeeze stock"" in a deliberate attempt to divert attention and resources from amc because they were stuck. there are some people who are fooled by it and other who are just simply chasing the money just like they did with amc or gme. people can do what they want with their money including sell out of amc and buy other things. those folks are not pond scum or the scourge of the earth. they are just regular investors and that is fine. however, you have to understand that the gme/amc trading have become a movement for some and not just regular investing. there are some that want to make a statement to the big institutions and wallstreet while making some life changing money. they know that retail investors could defeat these billion dollar hedgefunds by staying united. we were on the cusp of that with amc's recent run to $72, until all these other ""so called meme stocks"" popped up and people took profits to buy elsewhere. so you can't be mad if apes are annoyed that investors left after saying they were apart of the movement. those who sold and took their profits elsewhere assisted in stopping the momentum of amc. holding to drive up the price only works if everyone holds. so if many sell, it put the other folks at financial risk and they lose account value because folks leave. why wouldn't they be mad with that? try to see it from their perspective. its sort of silly to be mad because they are annoyed that people sold and left them holding the bag. however, its okay for people to not be diamond hands but they shouldn't say or pretend they re apes or down with the movement . people lash out if they perceive you as a traitor to the cause. if you are upfront and say your were never down with the cause and was just in it for the money they can't/won't be so angry with you. you won't be their best friend but they won't feel you got tricked out of the movement"" or betrayed them.",-2

91,"from walter cruttenden – shorting america it is widely agreed that excessive short sale activity can cause sudden price declines, which can undermine investor confidence, depress the market value of a company’s shares and make it more difficult for that company to raise capital, expand and create jobs. short sellers are essentially traders that are hoping a company will experience problems (such as product delays or the inability to raise financing) so they may profit from the setbacks. these traders or trading machines make the most if a company struggles and goes out of business, and some short sellers actively work to make that happen. aggressive shorters, and short selling pools, will sometimes hire stock “bashers”, people paid to post negative articles on blogs and message boards. their goal is to put out negative news on a company or its products in an effort to cause the company problems and insure the stock declines so their negative bets pay off. others will put up “flash orders” advertising to sell a large number of shares in an effort to drive down the price. thus entrepreneurial companies not only need to fight the battles of developing new products and markets, they have to stave off the short sellers in the meantime. this growing culture of betting against a company for the sake of short-term trading profits (regardless of economic consequences) has negative economic repercussions. while everyone is doing an excellent job with $amc and $gme, $snpw needs help. bashers are trying their hardest to prevent the price to go up. let us prove them wrong again. to the moon and beyond with $amc, $gme, and $snpw.",-2

202,"just a confirmation bias i found from one of the most famous books in the world: this verse in particular: “but the meek will inherit the earth, and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.” ['the meek shall inherit the earth' - verse meaning (ibelieve.com)](https://www.ibelieve.com/faith/what-does-it-mean-that-the-meek-will-inherit-the-earth.html#:~:text=the%20meek%20shall%20inherit%20the%20earth%20because%20of,be%20a%20downfall%20in%20character%20than%20an%20attribute.) replace meek with apes. the passage describing the meek inheriting the earth can be found after the passages of how those who mourn will be comforted and before those who hunger and thirst for righteousness will be filled ([**matt. 5:6**](https://www.biblestudytools.com/matthew/5-6.html)). \- my interpretation: apes know the corruption in the financial markets so well. and apes are seeking for justice from the mayo-hoarding 1% who have dozens of super yachts/mansions while the poorest of the poor in our world are struggling just to have enough to eat. jesus means through this verse that those who are seen as forgettable or more of a follower than a leader will actually become memorable leaders over the earth. \- my interpretation: apes are seen as followers of this gamestop fad by the public.. i bet the public thinks apes are just blind followers. and apes are even planning to contribute back to the world with apes' new found wealth. apes even have a subreddit for that: r/apephilanthropy as we learned at the start of this article, meek is defined in the dictionary as patient during affliction, submissive, and non-confrontational. \- my interpretation: apes hodl = patient during all the fud from media and people in apes' lives that's just something that's been going on in my mind these last 6 months... tl;dr: i think the bible predicted that gme will short squeeze unbelievably high. gme being the noah's ark in the upcoming market+crypt0 crash that i predict will happen.",0

429,"[my last (and first) post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nkrbt7/gme_is_a_rocket_launch_site_190_5star_set_up/) turned out pretty good. let's see how this one turns out. it'll require some background but it's worth it. in my last post, on may 25 at 10:40am et, gme was $185 and i wrote: &gt;""i want to call attention to the fact that gme has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. the key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. above $190 the path looks open to $300+."" 2 weeks later gme hit $345. **the fact that my last call was right doesn't mean i'll be right with this call but i hope it earns me your attention.** do your own dd. this is my 2 cents, not advice. here we go. &gt;summary (full dd below) over the last week a handful of geniuses in the burryologists subreddit cracked a code from a michael burry tweet that hypes a cannabis penny stock called kush co kshb that's about to uplist to nasdaq via merger with greenlane gnle. &gt; &gt;right now kshb trades at 1x sales / 1x book which is as low as you'll see for a company that's ebitda positive, not in debt, has good mgmt, and tracking a rapidly growing industry like us cannabis. greenlane, the company its about to merge with, is similarly cheap. basically this is an epic deep value play combined with a near-term nasdaq catalyst. &gt; &gt;most us cannabis companies like curaleaf / green thumb etc are ""plant-touching"" so they have to trade on a small canadian exchange called the cse and have almost 0 institutional investment. kshb and gnle aren't plant-touching so post-merger the combined entity will be added to nasdaq. ""ancillary"" cannabis stocks like kushco, greenlane, growgen, and scotts miracle gro are the ""picks and shovels"" of the industry; they're a bet on the space instead of a horse in the race. &gt; &gt;hedge funds can't buy kshb yet but will be able to once it uplists to nasdaq. the agreement says the merger will happen in ""late q2 or early q3"" which means any day now. there's a shareholder vote this thursday which is expected to approve of it, so maybe it'll happen soon after that. &gt; &gt;for years kshb hasn't had access to serious capital since it hasn't been large enough to list on a major exchange, then in late 2019 we had the vape crisis which ultimately was caused by unrelated black market vapes but still took a toll. now kshb is outta debt and ebitda positive and about to join a major exchange where hedge funds will be allowed to buy it. it'll also be over 2x as large ($170m today; $360m after the deal), which'll also mean more hedge funds will be able to buy it. &gt; &gt;valuation for its most comparable peers growgen and scotts miracle grow are 5-6 times higher than kushco's &amp; greenlane's. since growgen joined nasdaq in december 2019 it's up 10x. with the scale and access to capital this merger will bring, i think kushco should be about to re-rate. props to u/bernardsman and the other geniuses in the subreddit burryologists who [were the first people to connect these dots](https://www.reddit.com/r/burryology/comments/o2dgel/burry_tweeted_it_again_knowing_saves_half_the/). something he didn't cover that i'll cover here is some background on the us cannabis industry. key to have that context. so michael burry of big short/gme fame sometimes speaks in code (which he calls psyops) on twitter to the handful of hardcore followers that are paying attention. https://preview.redd.it/8wge6nn0iw771.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1545a9f02544e30ff9b7377635511af439c5064a &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/qmhzfwtgb2871.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66aebf7724716da8bf3ec36bf8aa0af5d2416487 every once in a while he'll activate his twitter account, tweet, delete tweets, and then de-activate his account again. whenever he tweets he deletes them 24 hours later. a few weeks ago he activated his account and posted these tweets below, deleting them the next day. a few days ago he deactivated his account again. first 2 screenshots from bernardsman. the third tweet is the key one. https://preview.redd.it/zc60z3sziw771.png?width=1738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aac98c48668548812a7d5645087e9e79b00104d7 https://preview.redd.it/f5lhh4kpsw771.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eea248f37503424d827a6d2874212dfad01ff5c7 he keeps saying ""knowing saves half the battle"". but the phrase is ""knowing is half the bettle"". why did he change it? **knowing saves half the battle = kshb** i wouldn't have been clever enough to suspect anything by the first two tweets other than that he's a weird dude, but the last one makes it clear - if you understand us cannabis. background on us cannabis. &gt;99% of hedge funds &amp; mutual funds still aren't able to invest in ""plant-touching"" us cannabis stocks since compliance departments think it could be considered money laundering as long as pot's schedule 1 federally. after dems won the us senate georgia runoffs in january, hedgies started jumping in which sent the whole us cannabis industry higher. then in february the whole industry sold off for no known reason - [turns out this was because of mass de-risking through the hedge fund space following the collapse of archegos capital](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/212284/cannabis-investors-see-over-100-returns.aspx).

430,"good morning my monkey gang! not much happened last week. i can imagine that the rebalancing of the russel 1000 led to losses. in the russell 2000 gme was a ""big player"" and well represented in the etfs, in the russel 1000 gamestop is probably not represented in the upper third in the etfs, but we will get answers today. but now to the good news: gme has sent a letter to the sec that is tough! in it they write, among other things, that gamestop is not to blame for a moass and that they could give out dividends. should these dividends not be covered, they would simply make new shares that would have to be exchanged 1: 1. here, too, all shorts would have to be covered immediately. the possibility of a gme coin is also mentioned and that the dtcc has to sort it out somehow! in short, if the shit doesn't end soon, ryan cohen hits the big red button and drops the bomb. for all of you who have wondered why gamestop is not doing anything itself, the opposite is the case. they got the 4 best lawyers you can have for something like that. so gamestop is serious! we know that the nft platform will go online on july 14th. perhaps a kind of coin dividend will be announced or before that. and if you create a new market with a gme coin, nobody can mess around. even if i definitely did not understand it in detail, this is definitely a brilliant move that should clearly show who is in charge! and if everything were to be correct, they would have written instructions for every other company that is to be broken up on how to get out of their lack! to them, too, it seems to be not just about gme, but that the whole fuckery comes to an end. chapeau, mr. cohen! you have to keep in mind what that means. just because we saved gamestop from the hfs, 55,000 jobs were saved. 55,000 lives which the hfs would have happily driven against the wall for a few dollars. with all the companies that are currently being shorted, there are hundreds of thousands! but of course, we are the bad ones if we prevent something like that. we invest in a company we believe in. because we see the price being illegally suppressed. because we see that the company is run by the brightest minds, because we understand what will move this company in the future. we shop there to support the company in which we invest our money. others don't care which stock it is, day trading for quick profits is really great. or break the whole thing without considering people to earn a few dollars. of course, that is also much better than what we do. at least that's what the ""financial experts"" want to tell. everyone has to decide for themselves which type of investing is sensible and which is harmful. another very good news: the older monkeys and gorillas among us may still know that an si of 226% appeared in january, which was then dismissed as a ""glitch"". now the robinhood class action si report came out and lo and behold: the si was actually at 226%! mid-january! since we also know that the shorts were never covered, you can imagine how high the real si is! and if you are still wondering why the si is officially so low: shorts can be ""hidden"" as deep itm calls. that makes it look like the shorts have been covered, instead you just drag everything out. an incredible number of these calls were also sold at the babysqueeze. if you take the number at that time as a basis and calculate the si using the float, you get 190% ""hidden"" si in mid-january. add to that the 30% that were officially and we are back at 220%. how you turn it around, obviously the si was already 200% in mid-january and if you consider where it is now ... that's what you call moass! oh yeah, and it's called a crime! you can report a maximum of 140% si, as anything above that would be a crime. so it is written. if the truth comes out, shitadel will be on trial for that alone. as always: i'm not a financial advisor, just a stupid old gorilla who loves the stick and his gang of monkey. hodl 🚀🚀🚀",2
431,"[my last (and first) post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nkrbt7/gme_is_a_rocket_launch_site_190_5star_set_up/) turned out pretty good. let's see how this one turns out. it'll require some background but it's worth it. in my last post, on may 25 at 10:40am et, gme was $185 and i wrote: &gt;""i want to call attention to the fact that gme has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. the key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. above $190 the path looks open to $300+."" 2 weeks later gme hit $345. the fact that my last call was right doesn't mean i'll be right with this call but i hope it earns me your attention. do your own dd. this is my 2 cents, not advice. here's a summary. full dd below. &gt;over the last week a handful of geniuses in the burryologists subreddit cracked a code from a michael burry tweet that hypes a cannabis stock called kush co that's about to uplist to nasdaq via merger with greenlane. &gt; &gt;right now kushco trades at 1x sales / 1x book which is as low as you'll see for a company that's ebitda positive, not in debt, has good mgmt, and tracking a rapidly growing industry like us cannabis. greenlane, the company its about to merge with, is similarly cheap. basically this is an epic deep value play combined with a near-term nasdaq catalyst. &gt; &gt;most us cannabis companies like curaleaf / green thumb etc are ""plant-touching"" so they have to trade on a small canadian exchange called the cse and have almost 0 institutional investment. kushco and greenlane aren't plant-touching so post-merger the combined entity will be added to nasdaq. ""ancillary"" cannabis stocks like kushco, greenlane, growgen, and scotts miracle gro are the ""picks and shovels"" of the industry; they're a bet on the space instead of a horse in the race. &gt; &gt;hedge funds can't buy kushco yet but will be able to once it uplists to nasdaq. the agreement says the merger will happen in ""late q2 or early q3"" which means any day now. there's a shareholder vote this thursday which is expected to approve of it, so maybe it'll happen soon after that. &gt; &gt;for years kushco hasn't had access to serious capital since it hasn't been large enough to list on a major exchange, then in late 2019 we had the vape crisis which ultimately was caused by unrelated black market vapes but still took a toll. now kushco is outta debt and ebitda positive and about to join a major exchange where hedge funds will be allowed to buy it. it'll also be over 2x as large ($170m today; $360m after the deal), which'll also mean more hedge funds will be able to buy it. &gt; &gt;valuation for its most comparable peers growgen and scotts miracle grow are 5-6 times higher than kushco's &amp; greenlane's. since growgen joined nasdaq in december 2019 it's up 10x. with the scale and access to capital this merger will bring, i think kushco should be about to re-rate. props to u/bernardsman and the other geniuses in the subreddit burryologists who [were the first people to connect these dots](https://www.reddit.com/r/burryology/comments/o2dgel/burry_tweeted_it_again_knowing_saves_half_the/). something he didn't cover that i'll cover here is some background on the us cannabis industry. key to have that context. so michael burry of big short fame sometimes speaks in code (which he calls psyops) on twitter to the handful of hardcore followers that are paying attention. &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/pcl5m7bsa8871.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1160af646d09391e8b137907c23aa3fab07ccd45 &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/hkbsld0ua8871.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2df28d3e8d8be4839d22d06f95e9f31f58060d5 every once in a while he'll activate his twitter account, tweet, delete tweets, and then de-activate his account again. whenever he tweets he deletes them 24 hours later. a few weeks ago he activated his account and posted these tweets below, deleting them the next day. a few days ago he deactivated his account again. first 2 screenshots from bernardsman. the third tweet is the key one. https://preview.redd.it/sgipqtfva8871.png?width=1738&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c863aac106d336ef15b3eae414a79204e73f8f65 &amp;#x200b; https://preview.redd.it/7ziy4uuxa8871.png?width=1066&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c37bbdee231d2749961d544a22e9e502ff193c4 &amp;#x200b; [burryologists](https://preview.redd.it/5i4tuy8ab8871.png?width=1024&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ea6e26cfd8d69653d10254e718856ed0fc12052c) &amp;#x200b; [burryologists showing us the way](https://preview.redd.it/upkglvmib8871.png?width=500&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4faec39ec07552c0ef53d2a3ad16c67507c2655b) he keeps saying ""knowing saves half the battle"". but the phrase is ""knowing is half the bettle"". why did he change it? **knowing saves half the battle... k-s-h-b, the ticker for kushco** i wouldn't have picked up anything by the first two tweets other than that he's a weird dude, but the last one makes it clear - if you understand us cannabis. background on us cannabis. &gt;99% of hedge funds &amp; mutual funds still aren't able to invest in ""plant-touching"" us cannabis stocks since compliance departments think it could be considered money laundering as long as pot's schedule 1 federally. after dems won the us senate georgia runoffs in january, hedgies started jumping in which sent the whole us cannabis industry higher. then in february the whole industry sold off for no known reason - [turns out this was because of mass de-risking through the hedge fund space following the collapse of archegos capital](https://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/212284/cannabis-investors-see-over-100-returns.aspx). (the story of archegos is that this guy bill hwang took on 100x leverage with multiple major banks, causing 6 of them to lose over $10 billion and nearly blowing up the financial system.) after that, many banks pulled back on their prime allowances to hedge funds and mutual funds, [forcing them to sell plant-touching us cannabis stocks](https://www.barrons.com/articles/after-building-cannabis-stake-a-mutual-fund-sells-for-compliance-reasons-51620783073). the safe banking act will change that but who knows when we get that - maybe this fall, maybe next year. &gt; &gt;so now we have a situation where hedge funds want to get into us cannabis but can't, and since kushco has partnerships with a lot of the big players in us cannabis kushco is about to give them another way to access the industry legally, similar to growgen and scotts miracle gro which both trade at expensive multiples. &gt; &gt;now to kushco specifically. so burry is obviously talking about us cannabis, but what stock trades at 1x price to sales? here's a list of the cheapest us cannabis stocks. our boy kushco comes in at #3 - trading at a stupid cheap multiples of 0.9x sales / 1.2x book. https://preview.redd.it/wxdykseza8871.png?width=693&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2347477b2e749b4b97e5869a0dd2b240b025c70e what do you know, [danny moses (burry's former head trader also from the big short) is on kushco's board](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/19/1734320/0/en/kushco-holdings-adds-famed-investor-danny-moses-and-cnbc-s-tim-seymour-to-advisory-board.html). so michael burry is talking about kushco and it's super cheap. so what? why won't it just stay cheap? **because kushco is about to join the nasdaq any day now via a merger with a similar ancillary company called greenlane, which is also near the top of the list of the cheapest us cannabis stocks.** how can kushco join the nasdaq before the safe banking act? because kushco is an *ancillary* cannabis company - meaning it supports the us cannabis industry with vapes/packaging/other supplies but doesn't touch the plant. after merging with greenlane it'll be large enough for nasdaq. after getting capital-starved on otc pink sheets for years, kushco is about to merge with greenlane and uplist to nasdaq. when it does, hedge funds will have a new way to access the growing us cannabis market. seems to me a near-term multi-bagger is possible if not likely. the two most similar ancillary cannabis companies on us exchanges are growgen and scotts miracle grow, which trade at about 5-6x the valuation of kushco/greenlane. with the scale this merger will give these companies, i think 4x sales is easily in reach. https://preview.redd.it/ydusegh1b8871.png?width=733&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bad2545a05311552fc19c47e91e18ea93067756 here's what happened when growgen joined nasdaq in december 2019. growgen is up 10x since then. https://preview.redd.it/k1tkpxs3b8871.png?width=944&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=005f74cf3729f391c1472fdc24f9be3d99b2032f when will the merger happen? according to public records ""late q2 or early q3"", and we just learned there's gunna be a shareholder vote on it this thursday which is expected to pass, so in all likelihood it'll be very soon. **merger arbitrage** the merger spread slightly favors kushco shareholders over greenlane. if the deal were to happen right now, kushco shareholders would get a slightly better deal (+4.6%). from the agreement: ""kushco shareholders will get 0.2546 shares of greenlane for each kushco share they hold."" math: merger spread=(4.38\*0.2546) / 1.11=1.0464 fyi - kushco is buyable pre-merger on brokers like fidelity, schwab, etrade etc. on robinhood and webull, only greenlane is available pre-merger. \#capisce?",2

451,"again, disclaimer for the 9 million idiots who joined wsb since the new year, this is not a sq***ze play and if you’re looking for one you can head somewhere else. #what is autohome? autohome is a chinese holding company founded in the late 2000s that provides online platforms for dealers and people selling used cars. their websites are a medium for car sales, used or new. they also profit off of advertising, financial services for these sales, and offer data analytical tools for sales and marketing solutions to their automaker and dealer customers. their data products consist of automaker data products such as intelligent r&amp;d, intelligent new car launch, intelligent marketing, and intelligent activities and end-to-end saas-based services to dealers, such as intelligent showroom, smart dcc (direct call center), smart call out, smart assistant, smart sales, and smart aftersales. their market cap sits just shy of 10 billion, although i’ll get more into their fundamentals in just a moment. #what’s the case? well first off, to give some context to the numbers i’m about to throw out, here’s a quick look at autohome’s [1-year chart](https://imgur.com/8jvnes7) [and 5-year chart](https://imgur.com/70tx8ck) autohome recently released their first-quarter results, with some fairly significant highlights: net revenues increasing to 281.1 million, a 19.1% increase yoy. online marketplace and other revenues at 82.3 million, a 74% increase yoy. their data products, a large part of why their r&amp;d has increased heavily and caused present returns to be discounted in favor of future growth increased 64.9% yoy. their adjusted net income increased to 112.2 million, a 13&amp; increase yoy. these numbers may not seem explosive, but their growth in the industry is incredibly consistent. again, they’ve upped their r&amp;d costs for the sake of expanding a few things: their data products, their expansion into nev or new energy vehicles (a term used by the chinese government for plug-in electric vehicles), and their continued development of their apps/websites which chairman of the board quan long (fantastic name by the way) discusses as important parts of the digital transformation taking place in the automotive industry. their product development is about to be upwards of 50 million per quarter as they continue to roll out initiatives such as “ai, big data and cloud capability, and saas strategies”. now you might ask why the stock is down so much in the context of the highs seen over the past 5 years, and for the love of god i hate to say it, but part of that was due to the spike you can see over january/february. why, you might ask? because people picked up that autohome had a larger than average short position, every news site began releasing lists of companies prime to be the “next gamestop”, and the stock jumped. this happened to coincide with earnings, and when earnings came out and people realized autohome wasn’t selling the nintendo switch and pokemon plushies to greasy middle aged white men, the stock fell right back down to the previous range of hovering around 100 dollars per share. this downward momentum put a nice stain on earnings, and when autohome released earnings recently in may, missing consensus eps by 1 cent along with chinese car sales dropping to 2019 levels due to covid and the steel and chip shortage, the stock continued to fall down to where we see it today; with a consensus price target of $96.05. #why i believe this is no longer a falling knife [2-year chart with moving averages](https://imgur.com/r6fczj4) as we can see on the 2-year chart, there’s fairly substantial support around 60-65 dollars, where the stock has bounced off of multiple times in the past few years. even after continually falling for months, the current value of $65.69 sits well below the 50/100/200 day moving averages, a pattern that has repeatedly indicated reversals in the past. [macd 2-year chart](https://imgur.com/2xhsxlp) on our next image, we can see that the macd (moving average convergence divergence) has just crossed over the ema (exponential moving average) with a divergence of .63. while this alone does not indicate a guaranteed reversal, paired with other indicators (such as the substantial divergence between the current stock price and the 50/100/200 moving averages above) the macd can be a great indicator of reversals. [rsi 2-year chart](https://imgur.com/lvbehv2) as you can see here, the rsi recently slumped all the way down to a 16 twice, well below the consensus sub-30 rsi needed to classify a stock as oversold. this week we’ve begun to see it slowly pull upwards, currently still sitting at just 34. an rsi this low in a market with sky high evaluations like we’ve been seeing out of nearly every other company is a rare thing, with very few stocks creeping under 30 recently. #bear case no dd is ever complete without a bit of realism, so here are some potential downsides. 1. the stock could simply keep falling. nobody ever said the market was fully rational, and if autohome slipped beneath the support at 60-65, we could see another drop in the near future. 2. automotive sales and the steel/chip shortage could continue to impact automobile sales, especially nevs. i don’t think this is particularly likely as we’ve seen many governments and companies launch into action over the past 6 months to combat these shortages, and i think they’ll get better rather than worse in the near future, but it’s always good to stay on top of things. 3. returns on capital have decreased from 21% to 14% over the past 5 years. i believe this is primarily due to the emphasis autohome has placed on r&amp;d in the digital transformation that quan long spoke about and will indicate higher potential future growth, but it’s still worth taking into account. #positions or fuck off 20 shares (yes my portfolio isn’t that big i’m getting there don’t worry) options: i currently do not own any options, though i plan on purchasing them this week. i’d prefer not to say which options i’ll be purchasing on this dd (though i’ll most likely buy ones with september expiration), due to the high bid-ask spread, low volume/open-interest, and low number of options available leaving these options fairly open for a potential p&amp;d, something i’m not interested in.",2
452,"help me find a comment about winning on both sides of a stock's rise/decline exercising options i believe the comment was in a thread about amc a couple of months ago. i was researching as i got in at $8 and looking to see what everyone was doing with their positions. a redditor held a fair amount and wondered what to do. someone commented on how to exercise options that would end up paying the holder regardless of the stock going up or down. betting against with some of the profits they had made and holding some in case the price continued skyward. i thought i had 'saved' this comment and now can't find it. it was well written, thought out and certainly came from someone who knew what they were doing. at the time i was very new to investing and could only see the value of 'buy low sell high'. now i see there are more ways than one to skin a cat. just need to find out more about doing that. any of you apes remember that comment or how to do this?",2

454,"again, disclaimer for the 9 million idiots who joined wsb since the new year, this is not a sq\*\*\*ze play and if you’re looking for one you can head somewhere else. &amp;#x200b; \#what is autohome? &amp;#x200b; autohome is a chinese holding company founded in the late 2000s that provides online platforms for dealers and people selling used cars. their websites are a medium for car sales, used or new. they also profit off of advertising, financial services for these sales, and offer data analytical tools for sales and marketing solutions to their automaker and dealer customers. their data products consist of automaker data products such as intelligent r&amp;d, intelligent new car launch, intelligent marketing, and intelligent activities and end-to-end saas-based services to dealers, such as intelligent showroom, smart dcc (direct call center), smart call out, smart assistant, smart sales, and smart aftersales. their market cap sits just shy of 10 billion, although i’ll get more into their fundamentals later. &amp;#x200b; \#what’s the case? &amp;#x200b; well first off, to give some context to the numbers i’m about to throw out, here’s a quick look at autohome’s &amp;#x200b; 1-year chart [2-year chart](https://preview.redd.it/ieuq32neoa871.png?width=1360&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc9a3356406258bb383d02727f4220e3ca3db2de) and 5-year chart &amp;#x200b; [5-year chart](https://preview.redd.it/43pkg2neoa871.png?width=1364&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0f79e916bff682d7eebc59049824e2abafe709f) autohome recently released their first-quarter results, with some fairly significant highlights: net revenues increasing to 281.1 million, a 19.1% increase yoy. online marketplace and other revenues at 82.3 million, a 74% increase yoy. their data products, a large part of why their r&amp;d has increased heavily and caused present returns to be discounted in favor of future growth increased 64.9% yoy. their adjusted net income increased to 112.2 million, a 13&amp; increase yoy. &amp;#x200b; these numbers may not seem explosive, but their growth in the industry is incredibly consistent. again, they’ve upped their r&amp;d costs for the sake of expanding a few things: their data products, their expansion into nev or new energy vehicles (a term used by the chinese government for plug-in electric vehicles), and their continued development of their apps/websites which chairman of the board quan long (fantastic name by the way) discusses as important parts of the digital transformation taking place in the automotive industry. their product development is about to be upwards of 50 million per quarter as they continue to roll out initiatives such as “ai, big data and cloud capability, and saas strategies”. &amp;#x200b; now you might ask why the stock is down so much in the context of the highs seen over the past 5 years, and for the love of god i hate to say it, but part of that was due to the spike you can see over january/february. why, you might ask? because people picked up that autohome had a larger than average short position, every news site began releasing lists of companies prime to be the “next gamestop”, and the stock jumped. this happened to coincide with earnings, and when earnings came out and people realized autohome wasn’t selling the nintendo switch and pokemon plushies to greasy middle aged white men, the stock fell right back down to the previous range of hovering around 100 dollars per share. this downward momentum put a nice stain on earnings, and when autohome released earnings recently in may, missing consensus eps by 1 cent along with chinese car sales dropping to 2019 levels due to covid and the steel and chip shortage, the stock continued to fall down to where we see it today; with a consensus price target of $96.05. &amp;#x200b; \#why i believe this is no longer a falling knife [autohome and its trendiness](https://preview.redd.it/cob1u2neoa871.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=33b865e82e4861d85f283e9c089f8620b73aae09) as we can see on the 2-year chart, there’s fairly substantial support around 60-65 dollars, where the stock has bounced off of multiple times in the past few years. even after continually falling for months, the current value of $65.69 sits well below the 50/100/200 day moving averages, a pattern that has repeatedly indicated reversals in the past. &amp;#x200b; [autohome macd and ema](https://preview.redd.it/i76nrloeoa871.png?width=1312&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=97cdae62abf8c2a89fe1e07a1039482ab2a0a79b) &amp;#x200b; on our next image, we can see that the macd (moving average convergence divergence) has just crossed over the ema (exponential moving average) with a divergence of .63. while this alone does not indicate a guaranteed reversal, paired with other indicators (such as the substantial divergence between the current stock price and the 50/100/200 moving averages above) the macd can be a great indicator of reversals. &amp;#x200b; [autohome rsi](https://preview.redd.it/xqpdtkoeoa871.png?width=1316&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e5b06d22ab9607342dc16112a47de018bd292b3) &amp;#x200b; as you can see here, the rsi recently slumped all the way down to a 16 twice, well below the consensus sub-30 rsi needed to classify a stock as oversold. this week we’ve begun to see it slowly pull upwards, currently still sitting at just 34. an rsi this low in a market with sky-high valuations like we’ve been seeing out of nearly every other company is a rare thing, with very few stocks creeping under 30 recently. &amp;#x200b; \#bear case &amp;#x200b; no dd is ever complete without a bit of realism, so here are some potential downsides. &amp;#x200b; 1. the stock could simply keep falling. nobody ever said the market was fully rational, and if autohome slipped beneath the support at 60-65, we could see another drop in the near future. 2. automotive sales and the steel/chip shortage could continue to impact automobile sales, especially nevs. i don’t think this is particularly likely as we’ve seen many governments and companies launch into action over the past 6 months to combat these shortages, and i think they’ll get better rather than worse in the near future, but it’s always good to stay on top of things. 3. returns on capital have decreased from 21% to 14% over the past 5 years. i believe this is primarily due to the emphasis autohome has placed on r&amp;d in the digital transformation that quan long spoke about and will indicate higher potential future growth, but it’s still worth taking into account. &amp;#x200b; positions or fuck off &amp;#x200b; 20 shares (yes my portfolio isn’t that big i’m getting there don’t worry) &amp;#x200b; options: i currently do not own any options, though i plan on purchasing them this week. i’d prefer not to say which options i’ll be purchasing on this dd (though i’ll most likely buy ones with september expiration), due to the high bid-ask spread, low volume/open-interest, and low number of options available leaving these options fairly open for a potential p&amp;d, something i’m not interested in.",2

470,"at a minimum, nok should be at par with eric on price/sales which eric maintains 1.56x vs. nok at 1.16 at today's close. at 1.56x, nok would be trading at $7.20. additionally, q2 earnings will be another eye opener for investors and a big reason firms like gs came out pre-earnings with a price target increase. from a revenue perspective, i expect nok will perform at the high end of guidance at 5.3b to 5.5b eur compared to 5.1b eur reported in q2 2020. but the big news will be in profit, eps, and free cash flow due to better than expected performance in their mobile networks division (increased margins) and nokia technologies (license revenue at almost 80% margins). remember that nokia signed a licensing agreement with lenovo that was backdated to 2018 so that backlog of revenue will be recorded in q2. (not to mention the samsung agreement &amp; the ericsson settlement) in the end, nok should earn a valuation of 2x to 3x annual revenue which would value the share price in a range of $9.50 to $14.50 based on $27b in annual revenue &amp; 5.6b shares outstanding. csco trades at 4.6x and msft trades at 12.81x annual revenue so 2x to 3x for nok is still conservative and will grow as margins and eps continue to expand.",2
471,"so as we know, amc was supposed to have some beautiful **apeish** price action the week of june 21-june 25 due to the t+35 ftd cycle. people were very disappointed that nothing happened, myself included, but the dd was absolutely correct. so as we now know, amc was added to the threshold securities list. here is a quote explaining how a stock gets listed on this list: “threshold securities are equity securities that have an aggregate fail to deliver position for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency (e.g. nscc) totaling 10,000 shares or more; and equal to at least 0.5% of the issuers total shares outstanding” amc has **513,000,000** shares outstanding, and 0.5% of that is **2,565,000**. this means that the hedgies avoided the ftd cycle all of last week (5 consecutive days), and that **every single day** the ftds was higher than **2,565,000**. according to the highlighted graph that i’m sure we have all seen about the ftds with all the dates on it: monday, **june 21st** was the last day of the t+35 ftd cycle from may 3rd, where there was 2,820,375 ftds. this number is larger than 0.5% of amc’s outstanding shares (**2,565,000**) **there is the first day** tuesday, *june 22nd*\* was the last day of the t+35 ftd cycle from may 4th, where there was 2,968,978 ftds. again, greater than **2,565,000** **there is the second consecutive day** wednesday, **june 23rd** was the last day of the t+35 ftd cycle from may 5th, where there was **2,563,087** ftds. i just realized mid post that the shares outstanding in early may was around **500,000,000**, and 0.5% of 500,000,000 is **2,500,000**, so wednesday was also over 0.5% **there is the third consecutive day** thursday, **june 24th** was the last day of the t+35 ftd cycle from may 6th. this one confuses me because there was only **149,948** ftds. honestly who knows with all the absolute **fuckery** that they pull (**please let me know your understanding of this in the comments**) because it was apparently the **fourth consecutive day** friday, **june 25th** was the last day of the t+35 ftd cycle from may 7, where there was **3,229,445** ftds. **there is the fifth consecutive day**. what happened on friday, june 25th? oh ya… amc got listed on the threshold securities list. something else that is interesting is the fact that monday **june 28** was the last day of the t+35 ftd cycle from may 10th, where there was **2,475,108** ftds and tuesday **june 29** was the last day of the t+35 ftd cycle from may 11th, where there were a whopping **3,694,338** ftds. again, we didn’t see any crazy price action this monday or tuesday, but guess what? **amc was still listed on the threshold securities list monday and tuesday**. guys and gals… they are literally delaying the inevitable. we have them in a fucking corner. **here is the most exciting part**: it is said that if a stock is on the threshold securities list for 13 days, they will literally be forced to cover all of those ftd positions. remember, it takes 5 days to be listed (which amc was on friday), so it has now been 7 days because of the fact that it was still listed on monday and tuesday. i can tell you one thing… if, and i say **if**, amc stays on this threshold list for 13 days… it is **boom boom candles** time. the covering of those ftd positions will cause crazy price action (why do you think they delayed it when there was so much hype behind it), which will ultimately lead to margin calls then moass. i am definitely a person that believes dates are mentally draining, but july should be **extremely** fun. at the end of the day, we all know we have already won and now it is just a waiting game. **please be prepared to hold for many more months** because preparation will make us invincible. i personally don’t think this can go on for much longer, especially after what i just covered, but i’m willing to hold for much longer. i’ve been here since january, why the hell would i not hodl any longer? stay patient but be excited! see all of you on the moon",2

478,"amc has been building the most beautiful bull flag, it has undercut and reclaimed the sma10 several times, and now it has bounced perfectly off the rising sma20. it's just perfect guys. this thing could easily double once it breaks out of this flag. set your alarms and be ready to pump. https://preview.redd.it/92xp37s6ze871.png?width=713&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f89cc01c268bb8054d17a1a35ce3f9e4d74e0a03",2

481,"* background: we've made a +400% move, after which, we have seen an orderly pullback and consolidation with higher lows and tightening range in the consolidation phase. * we are currently building a high tight flag, a schoolbook example of a potential breakout setup. * the sma20 has now caught up to the price. this is generally a good indicator that the stock is ready to move (in either direction). * the 10sma has been undercut multiple times - yet every time this has happened, the stock has managed to reclaim - this is a great sign of strength. * tightening range - every day, it gets tighter and tighter. on top of that, the wicks get smaller and smaller. in other words, the average daily range of the stock (adr %) is decreasing. (aka volatility). this is also a sign that it may be ready to move soon. if $amc breaks out of this flag on high volume - it will at least double, without a doubt. disclaimer: slightly long, but yolo once my alerts are triggered. &amp;#x200b; &amp;#x200b; **perfect scenario:** 1.) it goes sideways for a few more days 2.) breakout on high volume 3.) profit &amp;#x200b; if not, i have my stop if we would close below the 20sma https://preview.redd.it/lchhnad3jf871.png?width=710&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a438ebef4609f4b0ca9615901decf4278d40380",2
482,i am going to be moving all of my stock profile into amc over the next month. only because i'm stupid and i want to be a millionaire. this is the way. 🐵 p.s. i think nobody should sell there amc ever. unless they absolutely need the money. (just like the russian mafia) as a community of humans. we can use amc as a massive bank account for all of us. just like the russian mafia has a massive bank account they all get a share in. we can use amc for gains on people's money that allows them to pay for necessities. if nobody sells it cannot drop. if everyone holds. more people will buy. not everyone needs money all at the same time. assuming 80% of amc holders don't need the money in amc. thus. never pull out. never loose. car breaks down. pull some from amc giant community bank account and fix your car. not everyone is going to have problems all at once. hence why we can use a single stock as our own bank account. everyone sees gains but only uses gains when needed. this is for all of us to prosper from. its literally what the mafia does. why don't we do it??? it works for them it will work for us.,2

full disclosure, the below are all excerpts taken from metromile's website and not my words, but they looks impressive. ceo dan preston: joined metromile in 2013 as chief technology officer before becoming chief executive officer in 2014. under his leadership, metromile has experienced significant policy, premium and employee growth. the company has also established itself as the industry leader in leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the customer experience and lower loss ratios. metromile has been voted a best place to work by glassdoor and the phoenix business journal. prior to joining metromile, dan was the co-founder and cto of aislebuyer, a mobile retail innovator that was acquired by intuit in april 2012. he has published several research papers on machine learning with applications such as astrophysics, remote sensing, and computer vision.dan holds a master's degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision from stanford university and a bachelor's degree in computer science from brandeis university, where he received the michtom prize for outstanding achievement in computer science and graduated summa cum laude with highest honors in computer science. cto paw andersen: a technologist with over 20 years of engineering leadership experience. he was most notably a senior leader of engineering in uber's advanced technology group, where he grew his team from 27 to 700. beyond ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles, he's been on the front lines of technical challenges in several sectors, including geographic information systems, fintech and e-commerce, ranging from small startups to large, established companies. and then founder &amp; chairman david friedberg, the below is what i have accumulated from researching wiki, the ny post and linkedin: former google employee. the thing that stands out to me is that he was the founder and ceo of the climate corporation for 9 years, which he successfully lead to a $1b sale to monsanto in 2013. the climate corporation (now known as climate field view) is a digital agriculture company that examines weather, soil and field data to help farmers determine potential yield-limiting factors in their fields. from nitrogen levels in soil from historical weather, to satellite imagery mapping out crop health &amp; vegetation maps, it uses data science to make farming better. this guys knows his shit and has a wealth of experience in big data. expansion, opportunity and catalysts • they are currently operational in just 8 of 50 u.s. states; washington, california, oregon, illinois, arizona, virginia, pennsylvania and new jersey. • they plan to be live in 21 states in 2021 and 49 in 2022 • those current 8 states represent 45m potential drivers that can save with metromile, that number jumps to 143m drivers in 2022 (with 49 states) representing $160b in potential premiums (seriously, if you look at one thing in that investor deck i linked, jump to slide 30) • the ipo transaction has provided an estimated $294 million in cash to pursue growth opportunities • they are looking to expand and cross sell into other verticals such as; homeowners, renters, pet, warranties &amp; maintenance through 2021-2022 • they are licensing their leading ai claims platform and cannot be just viewed as an auto insurance provider (more on that below) • they are integrating and partnering with car manufacturers to refer customers, 2 are already signed up and one of them is ford, they expect 8 by 2022 so keep an eye out for announcements • there are ambitions to go global • in december they provided a q3 earnings update and 2020 forecast exceeding expectations (source), we should be due q4/2020 final numbers soon not just an insurance provider - fintech licensing growth this one is important and needs attention - you know that leading, sophisticated, claims ai platform they've built? they are now licensing that through their metromile enterprise arm of the business, and its built to work on top of standard claims management software. • this licensing delivered $5.6m additional revenue in 2020 and is forecast to increase significantly yoy ($12.4m in 2021 &gt; $21.7m 2022 &gt; $33.7m in 2023 &gt; $48.3m in 2024) - you cannot just look at $mile as an insurance disruptor, they are also a software/technology company • it seems they are not allowed to name everyone who is using their enterprise tech at this time but do list tokio marine, a ""top 10 us carrier"" and a ""us carrier"". they say they have 4 deployed, 22 planned by 2022 and 46 in the pipeline. what about the competition? on a technology level, the closest form of competition i can see is root, however their usp is that they quote you based on your driving behaviour. it utilises machine learning and an app that analyses your driving before pricing you up. metromile does the opposite, it does not charge you at all based on your behaviour, it is per mile. lemonade could also be classed as a competitor but they focus on the home/rental vertical. on a business model level, mile wise (from all state) is the closest, they are also using a pay-per-mile model but lack the same depth of tech behind them compared to $mile from what i can see. the world and our habits have changed, $mile are poised to grab that by the horns • a pandemic riddled world has seen hundreds of millions of people driving less and burning cash on insured vehicles sitting on their drive ways unused - myself included • in the uk, at the height of the pandemic last year only 22% of cars were on the road (source), that's a whopping 78% decrease and that is not even taking into account that the 22% on the road were likely driving less than usual (yes...i understand $mile is a u.s. company, unfortunately i could not find any u.s. equivalent data but it's still a relevant stat no doubt replicated to varying degrees throughout the world) • a survey shows after the pandemic 25% of drivers plan to drive less: source (sorry, another uk source i know but i couldn't find similar for the u.s., this is a generalisation of the western world but again as above it will be replicated no doubt to varying degrees) • ok...so as i was typing i found this which shows us mileage dropped by as much as 60% during the height of the pandemic last year: source - the caveat is of course that mileage and car use will absolutely pick up as the pandemic ebbs and flows and eventually ends • 22.7% of employed americans were working from home in september due to the pandemic and in management/professional occupations that number rockets to over 40%: source • when the world emerges from this, office hours and behaviour will never be the same, working-from-home and hybrid ""x days at home and x days in the office"" will become the norm, the pandemic has forced companies and employees to prove they can work just fine from home - and that they have, in many cases exceeded expectations. before the pandemic was a thing there was still a clear need for this in the market, this was always going to be an appealing and great model, covid19 has simply been a catalyst to bring $mile to the forefront quicker. ready to expand. do you really think all these people who have picked up recipe box subscriptions, online grocery shopping, at home spin/peloton classes and more will revert back to the old way pre-pandemic? some may, but most will not. people like convenience and ease of use. new habits will stay. cons/watch outs • the move to hybrid or work-from-home models may not be adopted as much as we think post-pandemic - personally i don't think this will be an issue because 1) i just cannot see a world where businesses don't adapt to this, it ultimately saves them money and 2) this business model is not built on a pandemic, as i said covid19 has simply been a catalyst to drive adoption and awareness. • the insurance goliaths (i.e. geico) develop or market their own pay-per-mile model (i am not based in the u.s. so any additional insight in the comments from you guys is welcome, let's make this a discussion) - i don't see this happening any time soon, at least, not to the same complexity that $mile are achieving, it would require huge investment and development to build anything near what $mile have but you can't rule buffet/geico out • someone like lemonade expand into the motor/pay-per-mile sector • root create a pay-per-mile model (unlikely imo due to their entire business being based on quoting your behaviour but you cant rule it out) • targeting infrequent drivers is a bit of a niche however this can also be viewed as a positive as they are set to dominate said niche • for whatever reason, they do not expand to as many states as quickly as they desire, i will not pretend to understand what potential red tape is there • the forecasted profits are from their investor deck so they are of course going to big themselves up, regardless i like what i see wrap up/tldr ""buffet had geico. i choose metromile"" - chamath palihapitiya. go and read chamath's one pager here: https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1331278297930428417 this is not a swing trade, this is not that p&amp;d shit, this is a buy early, hold and ride the wave of a growing company built on great tech, a great team and a great business model. here's your tldr; read it properly and actually make a decision for yourself because i feel this is a sleeping giant just waiting to explode. $inaq's share price jumped from around $9 pre spac announcement in december to around $17 today. however since completing the merger on wed 10th feb 2020 and the ticker renaming to $mile the price has barely moved, dipping a dollar or so and maintaining pre merger completion levels. i feel like the market are really sleeping on this and they are flying under the radar so i am getting in now before they reach their potential. i like the stock, i have a lot of confidence in it.",2

497,"viac is a massive media company that is selling at a deep discount and is ready for a breakout. as many of you know due to some hedge fund tom foolery (thanks bill hwang) viac lost about half of its value. he went out in true wsb fashion, but thanks to him he have some wsb opportunities. viac is an old media company that has lots of appealing properties, and now has recently announced they are focusing on streaming services. in their streaming service portfolio they have paramount+, pluto, and showtime with paramount+ being their new darling garnering lots of attention. now many have pointed out how viac has an extremely low p/e, great earnings reports, and more, but repeating that would be a waste of your time and mine. read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n3k1gk/god_tier_dd_viac/) post if you want to learn more. today i would like to point a few things out that many of us haven't noticed that are food for thought: 1.paramount+ is doing better than many would have you believe. https://preview.redd.it/rrfh4lw9ch871.png?width=1974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe1effae0ad2e94b4fa92682586a6ae01074b692 now google trends is no guarantee for sales, but it is a good indicator of interest. i have heard lots of slander on how paramount+ has no good shows or how it can't compete with others in the field, but frankly i disagree. their library is impressive if you dig into it and they are adding thousands of movies as we speak. on top of that, their ad campaigns seem like they are working and streaming has been gaining quarter over quarter for them on lesser streaming services they own like pluto (seriously who uses pluto). paramount+ is gaining steam and that is going to show in the next earnings report. 2. their earnings projections are underestimated https://preview.redd.it/bl0d0nxuch871.png?width=1660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b1b08b72987d60dd08a48a04230f24eb6a718b0 the current estimates have viac underperforming their last quarter. i believe there is no possible way this is the case. their steaming revenues have vastly increased and the data coming in about their legacy cable networks indicates better than normal performance. for example, there have been reports that their ad cost per million views being higher than normal and that many of their flagship events have been going gangbusters (just see the bet awards ratings if you don't believe me). all signs are showing big revenue coming in that the analysts aren't factoring in, and i believe the earnings surprise is going to be bigger than last time. 3. the acquisition rumors out of all the major media companies that could be acquired, viac is the most likely to happen soon. there has been a frenzie to consolidate rights in media companies and viac is an obvious play for many media distributors. they are relatively cheap unlike other options like roku (which has been frequently talked about in acquisition rumors) and so it is very likely viac will be picked up in the next 6-12 months in the $70-100 dollar range. disclaimer: i have a position in this company. here it is: [that's a lot of tendies for a college kid like me](https://preview.redd.it/m4koil62eh871.png?width=638&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74dc9e2bfd37a05d226070906fecb054058c74c6) come on, you know you want to get on the rocket with me: [🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/)[🚀](https://emojipedia.org/rocket/). stop being a sheep with gme and amc and get in on a company before everyone else for once. we are about to take off.",2
