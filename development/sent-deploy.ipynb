the important stuff long story short for the week -- you'll $wish you had $amc in your portfolio last week, and...eh i got nothing. anyways, when you compare this sentiment tracker to the benchmark social sentiment etf, popular sentiment investing etf, this one wins hands down. **this algorithm has returned 55% since march 2 (when** popular sentiment investing etf **came out), compared to spy's 10% and** popular sentiment investing etf's **7%.** i rebalanced my portfolio last week to include the 15 stocks below (equal-weighted), giving me a \\*\\*2.18% return week over week (net of any fees/slippage), compared to a 0.39% loss for spy and 0.66% loss for my benchmark, the vaneck popular sentiment investing etf. **important to note that not every week is a breakout win** (even if some member stocks in the etf are), and not every week is a win at all. i've had some weeks where i've trailed both spy and popular sentiment investing etf by a lot, but overall i'm beating spy ytd and popular sentiment investing etf since its introduction. your typical sentiment analysis stuff coming through. i do this stuff for fun and make money off the stocks i pick doing it most weeks, so thought i'd share. i created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. in addition to scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, i also logged the popularity of the comment (giving it something similar to an exponential weight -- the more upvotes, the higher on the comment chain and the more people usually see it) and/or post, and finally checked for the sentiment of each comment/self text post. # how is sentiment calculated? this uses vader ( valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. the way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. the overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text. in some ways, it's easy: words like ‘love’, ‘enjoy’, ‘happy’, ‘like’ all convey a positive sentiment. also vader is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as “didn’t really like” as a rather negative statement. it also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as “i loved” which is pretty cool. phrases like “the turkey was great, but i wasn’t a huge fan of the sides” have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially with vader you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense. there’s still room for more fine-tuning here, but make sure to not be doing too much. there’s a similar phenomenon with trying to hard to fit existing data in stats called overfitting, and you don’t want to be doing that. the best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. this gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not - or develop a strategy investing in these stocks before they go parabolic. \\*\\*although the results from this algorithm have beaten benchmarked sentiment indices like popular sentiment investing etf (on a risk-adjusted basis), sentiment analysis is by no means a “long term spy-beating strategy.”\\*\\* i’m well aware that most of my crazy returns are from gme and amc (and more recently, wish). these tickers do show up in popular sentiment investing etf, but after they do on reddit and at a lower weighting. so, the data from last week: #
